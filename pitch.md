# BACKLOT — Game Pitch Document

**Game Dev Tycoon meets The Player meets Tropico**

*An indie film studio simulation where every movie you make is a bet — art against commerce, ego against budget, vision against the festival jury's hangover.*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**Run a scrappy indie film studio in the mid-2000s — write scripts, wrangle ego-drunk actors, shoot on shoestring budgets, and pray Sundance puts you on the map before your investors pull the plug.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "My lead actor went method, my DP quit over a lens disagreement, my Sundance premiere got a 12-minute standing ovation, and I still can't make payroll."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

Picture this: the camera pans across a cluttered production office. Cork boards pinned with headshots and index cards. A whiteboard shooting schedule covered in dry-erase arrows and desperate question marks. The player drags a script from a stack marked "UNSOLICITED" onto the greenlight desk. The coverage report unfolds — a writer named Alejandro has pitched a non-linear drama about a deaf saxophonist in Reno. The tone analysis reads: "Ambitious. Possibly pretentious. Festival bait with genuine guts." The player greenlights it. Casting begins. Three actors want the lead. One is cheap but green. One is brilliant but demands final cut approval. One just got out of rehab and has an Oscar nomination on her IMDB page. The player casts. Then production starts — and everything starts going sideways in ways that feel like a Robert Altman film about making a Robert Altman film.

That is a thread people will quote-tweet with "I need this game immediately."

What is the hook in 5 seconds? You are the person who decides which movies get made. Not Hollywood movies. The weird, beautiful, probably-doomed ones. The ones that either win Cannes or go straight to a Blockbuster bargain bin. That tension between artistic ambition and financial survival — that is the scroll-stop. Nobody has built a sim around it. We are building it first.

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Loop

**30-second loop**: Read incoming material — scripts, headshots, budget sheets, festival invitations — and make decisions. Approve a rewrite, reject a casting suggestion, allocate a budget line, choose a festival submission. Every decision is a small bet with mechanical consequences across multiple interconnected systems: budget, morale, film quality, studio reputation, and your relationship with talent.

**5-minute loop**: Move through one phase of a production. Development (acquire and shape the script), Pre-Production (cast, hire crew, lock locations, set the budget), Production (manage the shoot day-by-day, handling crises, creative decisions, and actor meltdowns), Post-Production (edit, score, color grade, choose the cut), and Release (festival strategy, distribution deals, marketing push). Each phase has its own decision density and failure modes.

**Session loop (45-90 minutes)**: Shepherd one film from greenlight to premiere, then assess the fallout. Did it win anything? Did it make money? Did your best actor sign with a bigger studio? Did the reviews destroy your writer's confidence? Use the proceeds — financial and reputational — to greenlight the next project. Your studio evolves film by film. Each completed movie is a permanent mark on your studio's identity.

### Core Mechanics

1. **The Greenlight Table**: The central decision space. Scripts arrive from your writer pool, cold submissions, agent pitches, and your own development slate. Each script has procedurally generated attributes: genre, tone, structural ambition, thematic depth, commercial viability, and a "pretension index" that measures the gap between what the script thinks it is and what it actually is. The player reads coverage reports and decides what to develop. This is the most important decision in the game — what you choose to make defines everything downstream.

2. **The Talent Web**: Every actor, writer, director, DP, editor, and composer in your world is a simulated agent with stats, personality traits, ambitions, relationships, and an ego score. Actors have range profiles (some are naturals at deadpan comedy, others crumble outside of drama), salary demands that fluctuate with their career trajectory, agents who play hardball, and personal lives that generate events. A Talent Web map shows connections — who has worked together, who hates whom, who owes favors. Casting is not just about finding the best actor. It is about finding the actor who will show up, stay sober, take direction, and not alienate your DP.

3. **The Production Clock**: Once cameras roll, time becomes the enemy. Each shoot day consumes budget and generates a series of crisis events drawn from a deck seeded by your casting choices, location quality, script complexity, and pure bad luck. The DP and the director disagree on coverage. The lead is doing too many takes. Rain hits your exterior day. A teamster dispute shuts down base camp. You make decisions that trade time for quality, budget for morale, and control for chaos. The Production Clock is the pressure cooker — this is where films get made or fall apart.

4. **The Avid Bay (Post-Production System)**: After the shoot wraps, you enter the editing suite. The footage you shot is represented as a collection of scene cards with quality ratings across multiple axes: performance, cinematography, pacing, emotional impact, coherence. The editor assembles these into a cut. You can choose editorial approaches: tight and propulsive, slow and meditative, nonlinear, montage-heavy. Each approach multiplies certain quality axes and diminishes others. This is where a troubled production can be saved by a great editor — or where a smooth shoot can be ruined by a bad cut. The Score and Color Grade layers add final modifiers.

5. **The Festival Circuit (Release System)**: Completed films enter the release phase. You choose a festival strategy — premiere at Sundance for maximum American indie exposure, target Cannes for international prestige, go to Toronto for distribution deal density, or skip festivals entirely for a direct VOD/theatrical play. Each festival has simulated juries with taste profiles that shift year to year. Your film's attributes are scored against jury preferences, press appetite, and competition from other films in the lineup. A Palme d'Or nomination changes your studio's trajectory. A walk-out screening haunts you for three projects.

6. **The Ledger (Financial System)**: Money is the oxygen system. You start with seed funding and a credit line. Every production burns cash. Revenue comes from distribution deals (theatrical, VOD, DVD, international sales — this is the mid-2000s, so physical media still matters), festival prize money, and reputation-driven investor interest. The Ledger tracks burn rate, revenue projections, debt, and runway. You can take on investors, but investors want commercial projects. You can chase grants, but grants want artistic ambition. The tension between these funding sources is the economic expression of the art-vs-commerce theme.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner greenlights scripts that sound cool, casts the most famous actor they can afford, overspends on production, and submits to Sundance every time. They make one or two films before going bankrupt.

An expert reads the Talent Web like a chess board. They know that casting Actor A means Director B will demand a rewrite because they feuded on a set in 2004. They know that a $200K drama with a hungry unknown lead and a veteran DP will outperform a $1.2M ensemble piece with a star who phones it in. They manage the Production Clock by front-loading difficult scenes, keeping their best grip on standby for weather days, and knowing when to let the director run hot versus when to pull the reins. They read festival jury tendencies and time their submissions to avoid competing against frontrunners. They balance their slate — one commercial project funds two passion projects. They build a studio identity that attracts specific talent: "Oh, that's the studio that makes those sharp little character studies. My agent says they're good to work with."

The depth ceiling is in the Talent Web. At hour 100, the player is not managing individual films — they are managing relationships, reputations, and a creative ecosystem. The studio becomes a character. And the question shifts from "How do I make a good movie?" to "What kind of movies does my studio believe in?"

### Unique Mechanic

**The Greenlight Table** combined with **The Talent Web** creates something no other tycoon game has attempted: a management sim where your resources have opinions, egos, agents, and Oscar dreams. In Game Dev Tycoon, you assign a nameless team to a genre/topic combo. In Backlot, you are negotiating with a volatile actor's representation while your writer threatens to take her script to Focus Features if you cast "that guy from the insurance commercial." The units you manage are artists with taste, pride, and breaking points. This transforms every production from an optimization puzzle into a social negotiation — and it means no two studios will ever play the same way, because the talent you attract shapes the movies you can make.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**Beneath the budgets and box office, this game is about the cost of making something real.**

Every mechanic tells a story here. The Greenlight Table asks: what do you believe is worth saying? The Talent Web asks: what are you willing to tolerate from brilliant, broken people who can say it? The Production Clock asks: how much of your vision survives contact with reality? The Ledger asks: how long can you keep believing before the money runs out?

This is a game about the impossible, intoxicating, soul-grinding act of creation. Not creation in the abstract — not the clean montage of a writer typing THE END. Creation as it actually happens: compromised, chaotic, dependent on other people who have their own wounds and their own ideas about what the film should be. The player is not an auteur. They are the person who holds the space for auteurs to work — and who has to decide, every single day, how much space they can afford.

The lie the player tells themselves: "I just need one hit and then I can make whatever I want." The truth the game reveals: there is no finish line. The tension between art and commerce is not a problem to solve. It is the permanent condition of making things in a world that runs on money.

### The World

The mid-2000s indie film scene is a world between two deaths. The old model — shoot on film, pray for a Miramax deal at Sundance, ride Harvey's machine to the Oscars — is visibly rotting. The new model — digital everything, streaming, self-distribution — has not been born yet. Your studio exists in this gap. The technology is transitioning (your DP argues about digital versus 16mm on every single project). The economics are precarious (DVD revenue is starting to crater but nobody admits it yet). The culture is electric (mumblecore is happening, Brokeback Mountain just changed the conversation, A24 does not exist yet but the appetite for it does).

The wound of this world is Miramax. The dream factory that became a sweatshop. Every character in Backlot's universe has a Miramax story — the deal that changed their life, the phone call that destroyed them, the film that got buried. The shadow of what independent film was supposed to be versus what it became hangs over every cork board and coffee-stained script. Your studio is built on the rubble of that promise. The question is whether you will repeat it or redeem it.

The office itself tells this story. Early on, it is a converted loft with mismatched furniture, a landline that rings too much, and a poster for a Jarmusch film taped to the wall. As the studio grows, the space changes — nicer chairs, a real conference table, framed one-sheets from your own films. But the question embedded in the environment is always: does this feel like a place where good work happens, or a place where good work happened once?

### Player's Emotional Arc

**First film**: Naive excitement. Everything is possible. The script is brilliant, the cast is perfect, the festival will love it. Then production happens. The lead and the director stop speaking. The budget overruns by 30%. The rough cut is 40 minutes too long. The player wrestles it into shape, submits to Sundance, and gets... a polite rejection. The film goes to Slamdance. It makes $11,000. The player feels the gap between the movie they imagined and the movie they made. This is the most important emotional moment in the game — the realization that the gap is the work.

**Mid-career (films 4-8)**: Competence and its dangers. The player knows the systems. They can deliver a solid film on budget. The temptation is to play it safe — make the quirky dramedy that festivals reliably program. But the scripts coming across the Greenlight Table are getting more interesting, more ambitious, more expensive. The player feels the pull. Do I make the safe film that keeps the lights on? Or do I make the one that keeps me up at night?

**Late career (films 10+)**: Legacy. The studio has a reputation. Talent seeks you out or avoids you. The industry press profiles your slate. Former collaborators have become rivals, stars, cautionary tales. The player's emotional relationship to the game shifts from "How do I survive?" to "What have I built?" Some players will have built commercial engines. Others will have a shelf of festival trophies and mounting debt. The game does not judge either path. It simply asks: who is this character when no one is watching? Who is the player, when the credits roll on their studio's story?

### The Story Hook

**What kind of studio are you building, and what will it cost you to build it?**

There is no single narrative thread. The story is emergent — born from the accumulation of decisions, relationships, and films. But the game seeds narrative arcs through its talent. Your first writer will pitch you something personal and unmarketable in year three. Your breakout actor will get a Hollywood offer and you will have to decide whether to match it or let them go. A distributor will offer you a three-picture deal that guarantees solvency but demands you make genre films. A critic will write a retrospective of your work that either validates or eviscerates your choices.

Every mechanic tells a story. The Ledger tells a story about survival. The Talent Web tells a story about loyalty. The Festival Circuit tells a story about validation. The Greenlight Table tells a story about courage. The player's story is the sum of all of these — and it is different every time.

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Management sim and tycoon enthusiasts aged 24-40 who have played Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, or Tropico and want something with sharper creative teeth. They love systems but crave personality. They are the people who play tycoon games and think "Why are the employees just numbers?" They hang out on r/tycoon, r/BaseBuildingGames, and r/indiegaming. They have opinions about A24 films.

**Secondary**: Film enthusiasts and aspiring filmmakers aged 20-35 who game casually. They watch Every Frame a Painting on YouTube, own the Criterion Channel, and have a Letterboxd account with 500+ ratings. They play narrative games, walking sims, and the occasional management sim. The film industry subject matter is the on-ramp. They hang out on r/TrueFilm, r/Filmmakers, and Film Twitter.

**Tertiary**: Creative industry professionals who see themselves in the art-vs-commerce tension. Designers, writers, musicians, game developers — anyone who has had to choose between the project that pays and the project that matters. The game is a mirror for their professional lives, wrapped in a film industry skin.

### Comparable Games

1. **Game Dev Tycoon** meets **The Player (Robert Altman, 1992)**: The structural DNA of a creative-industry tycoon game, but with the satirical edge and human messiness of Hollywood's sharpest self-portrait. Where Game Dev Tycoon abstracts people into stat bars, Backlot makes people the entire game.

2. **Tropico** meets **Disco Elysium**: Tropico's political-identity-as-gameplay (are you a capitalist dictator or a communist idealist?) transplanted into a film studio. Your identity as a producer — commercial pragmatist, uncompromising auteur, people-pleasing collaborator — shapes every system interaction. Disco Elysium's personality-as-mechanic philosophy, applied to a management sim.

3. **Football Manager** meets **Barton Fink**: The obsessive, spreadsheet-deep talent management of Football Manager applied to actors, writers, and directors instead of midfielders. Each talent is a fully simulated personality. Recruitment is negotiation. Development is relationship management. And sometimes your star player locks himself in a hotel room and will not come out.

4. **Wilmot's Warehouse** meets **Robert Rodriguez's Rebel Without a Crew**: The spatial-organization satisfaction of managing a physical production office, combined with the scrappy, against-all-odds energy of micro-budget filmmaking. The cork board is your inventory. The shooting schedule is your puzzle.

5. **Pentiment** meets **Game Dev Story**: Pentiment's commitment to a specific historical moment and its material culture (every font, every margin, every ink color is period-accurate) applied to the mid-2000s indie film scene. Game Dev Story's addictive creative-combination loop, but with authored personalities instead of random number generation.

### Unique Selling Proposition

There are studio management sims. There are movie-making tycoon games. There is not a single game that simulates the human reality of independent filmmaking — the egos, the compromises, the 3 AM arguments about whether the ending works, the distributor who loves the film but wants you to change the title. Backlot is the first management sim where your resources argue back. The first tycoon game where the tension is not efficiency versus waste — it is art versus commerce, belief versus survival, the movie you want to make versus the movie you can afford to make. Nobody else is making this game because nobody else is treating creative management as a human drama rather than an optimization puzzle.

Show the GAME, not the features: the GIF is a player reading a script coverage report, casting an actor whose headshot has a coffee ring on it, watching dailies go sideways, and then sitting in a dark theater at Sundance as the audience score ticks up in real time. That sequence — from messy creative decision to public judgment — is the hook. It is the feeling of putting something into the world and holding your breath.

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)**: Primary and perfect. Management sims and tycoon games are Steam's bread and butter. The interface-heavy, mouse-driven design is native to PC. Steam's tagging system will surface Backlot to Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, and Tropico wishlists. The "Indie" and "Management" tags on Steam are chronically underserved by games with genuine creative depth — Backlot fills a gap.

**Nintendo Switch**: Strong secondary. The session length (45-90 minutes) fits portable play. Management sims perform well on Switch when the interface adapts cleanly. The cozy-but-sharp tone is perfect for the Switch audience.

**Mobile (iPad)**: Stretch target. The cork-board interface and drag-drop interactions translate naturally to touch. The mid-session save-and-resume pattern works for mobile play sessions.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (non-negotiable)

1. **The Greenlight Table**: Script acquisition and development system. Procedurally generated scripts with meaningful attribute variation (genre, tone, ambition, pretension, commercial viability). Coverage reports that read like real coverage. The decision of what to make is the game's thesis in mechanical form.

2. **The Talent Web**: Fully simulated talent ecosystem. Every actor, writer, director, and crew head has stats, personality, relationships, career trajectory, and ego. Casting is negotiation. Collaboration is relationship management. The Talent Web is the system that makes Backlot a human drama rather than a spreadsheet.

3. **The Production Clock**: Day-by-day shoot simulation with crisis events, creative decisions, and resource management. This is the pressure-cooker phase where plans meet reality. Event decks seeded by casting, script, location, and budget decisions ensure that every production feels consequential and unique.

4. **The Avid Bay**: Post-production system where raw footage is shaped into a finished film. Editorial approach selection, score, color grade, and final cut decisions. The space where troubled productions can be rescued and smooth productions can be ruined. This is where the film's final quality crystallizes.

5. **The Festival Circuit and Distribution**: Festival submission strategy, jury simulation, distribution deal negotiation, and revenue tracking. The public-facing consequence of every private creative decision. Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, Venice, Berlin — each with distinct personalities, jury tastes, and industry dynamics.

### Stretch Goals (ordered by impact)

1. **The Awards Season Track**: Post-festival awards campaign simulation. For-Your-Consideration ads, screening events, guild politics, and the slow grind toward Oscar nominations. A late-game prestige system that adds a whole new layer of industry navigation.

2. **The Rival Studio System**: AI-controlled competing indie studios with their own identities, slates, and talent rosters. They compete for scripts, talent, festival slots, and distribution deals. The player's studio exists in an ecosystem, not a vacuum.

3. **The Director's Chair Mode**: A focused mode where the player takes on a single director's career instead of a studio. Tighter scope, deeper creative control, more personal stakes. A different way to play the same systems.

4. **The Industry Events System**: Expanded simulation of parties, premieres, panel discussions, and chance encounters. Networking as gameplay. Meeting your next collaborator at a Q&A after a midnight screening.

5. **The Criterion Shelf**: A meta-collection system where the player's best films are immortalized in a curated library with generated cover art, pull quotes, and "special features" text. The ultimate trophy case for the art-over-commerce player.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Real-time filmmaking gameplay**: You are the producer, not the director. You do not control the camera or block scenes. The production is simulated, not played moment-to-moment. Adding direct filmmaking mechanics would split the game's identity and triple the scope.
- **Multiplayer / competing studios at launch**: The single-player simulation needs to be airtight before adding competitive dynamics.
- **Procedural dialogue trees with talent**: Talent interactions should be authored event-driven, not open-ended conversation. Authored content ensures personality consistency.
- **Historical real-world actors or films**: All talent and films are fictional. Licensing is a nightmare, and fictional characters can be more interesting than caricatures of real people.
- **Film-within-a-film playback**: You never "watch" your completed films. You see their scores, read reviews, and watch audience reactions. The film exists as data and reputation, not as rendered footage. This is a deliberate design choice — the player's imagination fills in what the numbers describe.

---

## KEY ART / MOOD DIRECTION

**Hero image**: A cluttered production office shot from above, almost like a diorama. Cork boards bristling with headshots connected by red string. A whiteboard shooting schedule half-erased and rewritten. Scripts in manila envelopes stacked on a desk next to a cold coffee and a ringing landline. Festival laurels pinned to the wall — some real, some aspirational. Through the window, a backlot is visible: a half-built set, a camera on a dolly, crew members in motion. The lighting is warm incandescent — late afternoon in a space where people work too hard on things they care too much about.

**Color palette**:
- `#2C1810` — Dark espresso, the shadows and desk surfaces
- `#D4A574` — Warm manila, the scripts and envelopes and cork boards
- `#8B2500` — Sundance red, the festival urgency and passion
- `#1A3A5C` — Cannes midnight blue, prestige and ambition
- `#F5E6C8` — Warm cream, the paper and light and office warmth
- `#4A7C59` — Money green, the Ledger and financial health
- `#C0C0C0` — Film canister silver, the industry and the physical medium
- `#FFD700` — Award gold, the Palme d'Or and Oscar dream

**UI mood**: Diegetic and tactile. The interface IS the production office. Scripts are physical documents with dog-eared pages and margin notes. The shooting schedule is a whiteboard with magnetic strips. Headshots are pinboard photos with handwritten notes. The budget is a spreadsheet on a CRT monitor running Excel 2003. Festival programs are printed booklets. Everything you touch in the UI feels like something that exists on a desk in a Soho loft in 2005. The font is a mix of Courier (scripts), Helvetica (business documents), and handwritten scrawl (notes and annotations).

**Audio mood**: The ambient soundscape of a working office — phones ringing in other rooms, the hum of a computer, traffic through an open window. Music is diegetic when possible: a temp track playing in the editing suite, the score composer's demo coming through laptop speakers. Menu music is a warm, slightly melancholy acoustic guitar piece — the kind of thing you would hear over the opening credits of a Sundance film about people trying to make a Sundance film. During festival sequences, the audio shifts to the electric murmur of a crowded theater before the lights go down.

## OPEN QUESTIONS AND NEXT STEPS

### Design Questions [REED]
- What is the right number of productions per in-game year to maintain pacing without exhaustion? Two feels lean; four feels frantic. Three is the instinct, but it needs testing.
- How granular should the Production Clock be? Day-by-day is the current plan, but does that create too many micro-decisions per shoot? Could a week-by-week structure with key decision points preserve tension while reducing fatigue?
- How does the Talent Web scale? With 50 active talents in the world, relationship tracking is rich. With 200, it might be overwhelming. Where is the sweet spot?
- What is the failure state? Studio bankruptcy is obvious, but is there a softer failure — creative irrelevance, the industry moving on without you — that is more interesting and less punishing?
- How do we balance the Greenlight Table so that "artsy" and "commercial" scripts are both viable paths without one dominating? The economy has to support both strategies.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]
- What does the player FEEL when they read a generated script coverage report? It has to feel like reading a real logline — sparking imagination, not presenting data. How do we write procedural text that has voice?
- Who are the recurring characters in the Talent Web that anchor the experience? Every playthrough should have a handful of memorable personalities — the diva, the prodigy, the veteran who will not compromise, the agent who is both your best friend and your worst enemy.
- Where does the world crack? The mid-2000s indie film scene is not just a setting — it is a moment of transition. How do we make the player feel the ground shifting under them? The Weinstein trial is years away, but the culture that enables it is already present. How do we engage with that shadow without being exploitative?
- What is the story the player tells themselves about their studio? The emergent narrative needs to crystallize into something the player can articulate: "I'm the studio that takes risks on first-time directors" or "I'm the studio that makes beautiful films that nobody sees."

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]
- What is the announcement asset? A fake "coverage report" for the game itself — written in the style of a script reader evaluating a pitch — would be a viral-ready format that communicates tone and concept simultaneously.
- Where is the community? Film Twitter, Letterboxd, and r/TrueFilm are obvious targets, but they are not traditional gaming communities. The crossover audience — people who love both games and film — is underserved and vocal. Start building the audience NOW on those platforms.
- What is the demo? A single production cycle — greenlight, cast, shoot, edit, premiere — with enough Talent Web depth to show the human drama. The demo ends at the festival premiere with the audience score climbing in real time. That is the moment that converts a player into a wishlist.
- How does this look on a Steam capsule? A cork board with headshots and red string, BACKLOT in a warm serif font across the top, a festival laurel in the corner. Warm tones. The capsule should say "indie film" and "management sim" simultaneously. It should look like a Criterion Collection cover for a game about making Criterion Collection films.

### Next Steps

1. Prototype the Greenlight Table with 20 procedurally generated scripts. Test whether coverage reports feel alive or algorithmic.
2. Build a paper prototype of the Talent Web with 10 characters and simulate three production cycles. Find the emergent drama.
3. Prototype the Production Clock with a single film shoot. Calibrate crisis event frequency and decision weight.
4. Design the Avid Bay interface. Test whether editorial approach selection feels creative or mechanical.
5. Write the festival jury simulation. Model Sundance, Cannes, and Toronto with distinct taste profiles.
6. Produce a mood piece: a 60-second video of the production office interface set to ambient office audio. This is the first marketing beat — show the workspace, let people project themselves into it.
7. Steam page goes live the moment the cork board looks real.

*This pitch document was generated by REED (Game Designer), NOVA (Narrative Designer), and HYPE (Marketing). The game lives or dies on one question: can a management sim make the player feel what it actually feels like to make something — the terror, the compromise, the 2 AM conviction that this one matters, and the morning-after fear that it doesn't?*
