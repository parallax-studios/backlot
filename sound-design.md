# BACKLOT — Sound Design Document

**Sound Designer & Composer: ECHO**
**Version 1.0 — Production-Ready**

## 1. Sonic Identity Statement

Close your eyes.

You are sitting in a converted loft in Soho, late afternoon light through unwashed windows. A phone rings three rooms away, muffled. The ceiling fan hums in F#. Someone is typing coverage on a mechanical keyboard. Traffic breathes through the open window — taxi horns, distant sirens, the city's white noise. A coffee mug scrapes against a wooden desk. Paper shuffles. A ballpoint pen clicks twice, then scribbles notes in the margin of a script.

Now it is night. The office is empty except for you. The computer monitor hums. A film plays on worn laptop speakers — someone's rough cut, audio poorly mixed, dialogue clipping. You stop it. Rewind. Watch the same scene again. Outside, rain begins.

Now you are in a dark theater. The sound of breath, of fabric shifting, of someone next to you unwrapping a mint. The film begins. The audience disappears. There is only the screen and the sound, and then — applause. Or silence. Either way, you hear it in your bones.

**That is BACKLOT's sonic world.**

This is not a game about making films. This is a game about the spaces where films are shaped — cluttered offices where decisions happen, chaotic sets where plans collapse, dark theaters where judgment arrives. The sound design must make those spaces feel inhabited, urgent, alive. Audio IS the game feel. Without it, BACKLOT is a spreadsheet. With it, BACKLOT is a working film studio, breathing, creaking, ringing, humming with the nervous energy of people betting everything on something fragile.

The sonic identity is: **intimate production realism layered with emotional minimalism.** Diegetic sounds dominate. Every click, every ring, every shuffle reinforces that the player is in a physical workspace making physical decisions. Music is sparse, deliberate, and always motivated by the narrative moment. Silence is a sound design choice — used to create anticipation before festivals, to mark the end of a troubled production, to let the player sit with a decision.

This is the sound of making something real. This is the sound of hope and compromise and the freight train you hear coming when you have bet everything on a film about a deaf saxophonist in Reno.

## 2. Sonic Palette

### 2.1 Core Tonal Framework

The sonic palette is built on three tonal layers that define BACKLOT's audio architecture:

**LAYER 1: THE OFFICE (Ambient Foundation)**
- **Tone**: Warm, cluttered, lived-in, slightly worn
- **Character**: Lo-fi realism, analog textures, human presence
- **Keynote sound**: The hum of a mid-2000s desktop computer (constant, 120 Hz with harmonic overtones)
- **Soundmarks**: Landline phone ring (classic two-tone bell), mechanical keyboard clatter, papers shuffling, the creak of a cheap office chair, the click of a ballpoint pen, the scrape of a coffee mug on wood
- **Signal sounds**: Incoming script notification (manila envelope sliding across desk), budget alert (calculator beep), crisis event (phone ringing urgently), talent reaction (distant conversation murmur, laughter, or a door closing with finality)

**LAYER 2: THE PRODUCTION (Controlled Chaos)**
- **Tone**: Active, pressured, volatile, real-time
- **Character**: Set ambiance with industrial undertones, human voices in the mid-distance, equipment presence
- **Keynote sound**: Set ambiance bed — crew chatter 30 feet away, equipment hum, the occasional clap of a slate
- **Soundmarks**: Director calling "Action" and "Cut" (voice-over, distant), camera dolly wheels on track, C-stand adjustments, gaffer tape ripping, walkie squelch and chatter, footsteps on set floors
- **Signal sounds**: Crisis alerts (radio squelch followed by "We have a problem"), morale shifts (crew energy rising or falling in the ambiance bed), dailies quality indicators (film projector rattle vs. clean digital playback)

**LAYER 3: THE PREMIERE (Public Judgment)**
- **Tone**: Tense, cinematic, held-breath anticipation
- **Character**: Theater acoustics, audience as organism, emotional extremes
- **Keynote sound**: Theater HVAC hum (very low, 60 Hz), audience ambient murmur
- **Soundmarks**: Theater doors closing with weight, house lights dimming (electrical hum fading), projector start-up, footsteps on carpet, program pages turning
- **Signal sounds**: Audience reactions (walkouts, polite applause, enthusiastic applause, standing ovation, laughter, silence), festival announcement voice-over, press camera shutters

### 2.2 Instrumentation & Source Palette

All audio in BACKLOT is either diegetic or diegetically-motivated. The player never hears orchestral swells from nowhere. Music enters the world the way music enters real production spaces — through speakers, through temp tracks, through demo playback.

**Environmental Audio Sources**:
- Mid-2000s office equipment: CRT monitors, mechanical keyboards, laser printers, landline phones, desk fans, radiator clank
- Physical media: Paper shuffle (scripts, contracts, coverage reports), pen on paper, stapler, file cabinet drawers, cork board pins
- Production equipment: Film cameras (16mm Mitchell, Arri SR3), digital cameras (early Canon 5D), lighting equipment (HMI ballast hum, fresnel barn door clank), grip stands
- Human presence: Footsteps (concrete, wood, carpet), chair creaks, door opens/closes, breath, fabric rustle, distant conversations

**Musical Palette** (when music appears):
- Solo acoustic guitar (fingerstyle, warm, slightly melancholic) — menu music, reflective moments
- Solo piano (prepared piano textures, minimal melodic fragments) — emotional peaks, character moments
- String quartet (small ensemble, chamber music intimacy) — festival sequences, awards moments
- Analog synthesizers (Moog, Prophet-5, vintage textures) — temporal markers (the mid-2000s indie aesthetic), montage sequences
- Diegetic temp music playback (from in-world sources: laptop speakers, editing bay monitors, car stereos) — procedurally selected based on film genre/tone

**Vocal Presence**:
- Voice-over snippets (never full dialogue, always fragments): director's voice on set, agent on phone, festival announcer, critic's quote read aloud
- Crowd reactions: murmurs, laughter, applause, silence
- Telephone voices (filtered, tinny, emotionally charged)

### 2.3 Reference Tracks & Inspiration

The sonic references are less about "what music plays" and more about "what spaces sound like."

**Film References** (for spatial audio design):
- *The Social Network* (2010) — Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross — the sound of obsessive work in small rooms, computers humming, the isolation of creation
- *All That Jazz* (1979) — Ralph Burns — editing bay sequences, the sound of film being cut, temp music playing through monitors
- *Birdman* (2014) — Antonio Sánchez — diegetic drum score, the sound bleeding between reality and performance
- *Living in Oblivion* (1995) — Jim Farmer — chaotic indie film set audio, walkie chatter, crew tension
- *Adaptation* (2002) — Carter Burwell — anxious creative process, the sound of typing, of pacing, of scripts being discarded

**Music References** (for emotional tonality):
- Dustin O'Halloran — *An Ending, A Beginning* — minimalist piano, emotional without melodrama
- Ólafur Arnalds — *Near Light* — prepared piano and strings, intimate and vast simultaneously
- Jóhann Jóhannsson — *Englabörn* — analog synth textures, warmth with melancholy
- Explosions in the Sky — *Your Hand in Mine* — quiet builds, emotional crescendos that earn their space
- Mark Orton — *My Winnipeg* score — quirky Americana, slight absurdity, very human

**Environmental References**:
- NPR studio ambiance — the sound of thoughtful work, paper, coffee, low conversation
- Film editing suites (Avid bays, Steenbeck rooms) — mechanical film transport, keyboard shortcuts, timeline scrubbing
- Actual mid-2000s indie film sets — the particular acoustic quality of warehouse spaces converted to sets, the city bleeding in through loading dock doors

## 3. SFX Design — Organized by Game System

### 3.1 THE GREENLIGHT TABLE (Development Phase)

**Core player verbs: READ, EVALUATE, GREENLIGHT**

This is the contemplative space. Audio must support focus and the weight of choice.

**SCRIPT ARRIVAL & HANDLING**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `script_envelope_slide` | Manila envelope sliding onto desk | New script appears in inbox | Cardstock on wood, slight weight, 0.8s duration. Pitch varies slightly per script genre (drama = deeper, comedy = lighter) |
| `script_page_flip` | Single page turn | Player navigates coverage pages | Thin paper, crisp turn. Randomize from pool of 8 variations. Light reverb (small room). |
| `script_page_flip_multi` | Multiple pages flipped quickly | Player skips to end of coverage | Rapid flutter, 1.2s, paper density increases toward end |
| `margin_note_scribble` | Pen writing in margin | Player highlights/bookmarks script | Ballpoint on paper, 0.5-1.5s, pressure and speed vary. Not every click needs sound — only deliberate markings |
| `script_stack_drop` | Script dropped onto "pass" pile | Player rejects script | Heavier than slide, finality. Thud of 120 pages hitting desk. Low-mid frequency bump (200-400 Hz) |
| `script_pin_corkboard` | Script pinned to development board | Player greenlights script | Cork compression, metal pin through paper, slight board creak. THIS SOUND MATTERS — it is commitment made physical |

**COVERAGE READING INTERFACE**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `coverage_folder_open` | Coverage report folder opened | Player selects script to read | Cardstock folder, papers inside shift, 0.6s |
| `highlighter_squeak` | Highlighter marking text | Player mentally notes key attribute | Chisel tip on paper, slight squeak, yellow marker specifically (nostalgia trigger) |
| `coffee_sip_decision` | Coffee mug lifted, sipped, returned | Player pauses to think (idle 8+ seconds on coverage page) | Ceramic on wood (pickup), liquid sip (small), ceramic return (gentle). Subtle. Grounds the player in the moment |
| `phone_buzz_agent` | Cell phone vibrates on desk | Agent message arrives with attached script | Mid-2000s flip phone vibrate against wood desk. Louder, more insistent than script arrival |

**GREENLIGHT DECISION MOMENT**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `greenlight_stamp` | Rubber stamp on paper | Player confirms greenlight | Heavy stamp, ink pad contact, paper thud. Authority. Finality. Red ink (implied sonically by heavier impact). 1.2s with slight reverb tail |
| `budget_projection_print` | Dot matrix printer | Budget sheet generates post-greenlight | Period-accurate printer (Epson LQ-570), 3-4 seconds of printing. Nostalgic, mechanical, grounding |
| `writer_phone_call` | Phone rings, brief conversation murmur | Writer reacts to greenlight | Phone ring (2 rings), pickup, muffled voice (grateful/nervous based on writer personality), 8-12s total. Voice is heard but not intelligible (emotional tone only) |

**AMBIANCE BED — GREENLIGHT TABLE PHASE**

| Layer | Content | Mix Level | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Base ambiance | Office room tone, computer hum (120 Hz), distant traffic | -32 dB | Constant, barely conscious |
| Punctuation | Phone rings in other room (every 90-180s), door open/close (every 120-240s) | -28 dB | Establishes the office as a working space beyond the player |
| Detail layer | Keyboard typing (distance: 20 feet), coffee maker gurgle (once per 5 minutes), footsteps in hallway | -30 dB | Human presence. The player is not alone |

**Silence map**: When the player hovers over the greenlight button, ambiance dips to -40 dB for 1.5 seconds. The decision exists in near-silence. Then, commitment.

---

### 3.2 THE TALENT WEB (Pre-Production Phase)

**Core player verbs: SCOUT, NEGOTIATE, MANAGE**

The Talent Web is relational. Audio must communicate connection, tension, chemistry, distance.

**WEB VISUALIZATION & NAVIGATION**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `web_node_select` | Talent headshot clicked | Player selects talent | Soft tap, polaroid photo texture. Pitch shifts based on relationship score: warm (positive), neutral, cold (negative) |
| `web_string_illuminate` | Connection string lights up | Player hovers over talent to see connections | Subtle sine tone (varies per relationship type: green = 440 Hz, red = 220 Hz, gold = 660 Hz), 0.4s attack, 2s decay |
| `web_zoom_in` | Camera zooms to talent cluster | Player focuses on specific talent group | Gentle whoosh, not sci-fi. Paper sliding closer on desk. 0.8s |
| `web_relationship_shift` | String color changes | Relationship score changes post-event | Depending on direction: positive = string tuning up (pitch rise, 0.6s), negative = string loosening (pitch drop, slight discord) |

**CASTING & NEGOTIATION**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `headshot_drag` | Talent headshot dragged to role slot | Player drags actor to casting | Paper slide, slight resistance (hand on photo), 0.5-1.2s depending on drag distance |
| `casting_slot_snap` | Headshot snaps into role | Player releases headshot in valid slot | Magnetic click, satisfying. Polaroid settling into frame. Pitched slightly higher for lead roles, lower for supporting |
| `phone_ring_agent_incoming` | Agent calls to negotiate | Negotiation sequence begins | Two-tone landline ring. Insistent. Player must answer (click) to proceed |
| `agent_voice_filter` | Agent voice snippet plays | During negotiation dialogue | Phone-filtered voice (bandpass 300-3000 Hz, slight distortion). Emotional tone varies: friendly, curt, aggressive. Never fully intelligible words, only tone and cadence |
| `contract_page_flip` | Contract pages reviewed | Player navigates negotiation options | Heavier paper than script (legal weight), stiffer flip |
| `pen_signature` | Contract signed | Player accepts deal | Pen on paper, deliberate signature stroke, 1.8s. Finality. Ink is permanent |
| `contract_reject_crumple` | Contract refused | Player walks away from negotiation | Paper crumpled, tossed (light throw), lands in trash bin. Agent relationship ding (subtle negative string tone) |

**CHEMISTRY INDICATORS**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `chemistry_positive_chime` | Pleasant harmonic | Two actors with high chemistry are cast together | Two-note harmony (major third interval), warm timbre (vibraphone or marimba), 1.2s. Not magical — grounded, like tuning forks in agreement |
| `chemistry_negative_dissonance` | Tense microtonal clash | Two actors with negative chemistry are cast together | Minor second interval, slight beating (6-8 Hz), unsettling but not aggressive. Fades over 2s. Warning, not punishment |
| `loyalty_bonus_indicator` | Subtle positive texture | Talent with high loyalty accepts role | Warm pad swell (very quiet, -36 dB), 2s. Barely noticeable but emotionally supportive |

**AMBIANCE BED — TALENT WEB PHASE**

| Layer | Content | Mix Level | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Base | Same office room tone as Greenlight phase | -32 dB | Continuity |
| Telephone layer | Phone conversations in adjacent room (muffled, unintelligible, every 60-120s) | -30 dB | Negotiation happens everywhere. Agents never stop calling |
| Paper layer | Scripts and headshots being shuffled on other desks | -34 dB | The studio is alive with activity |

**Silence map**: During final casting decision (before pen signature), ambiance drops to -38 dB. The moment before commitment is quiet.

---

### 3.3 THE PRODUCTION CLOCK (Production Phase)

**Core player verbs: MANAGE, RESPOND, SACRIFICE**

Production is controlled chaos. This is the loudest, most volatile phase. The soundscape must communicate momentum, morale, and crisis in real time.

**SET AMBIANCE — DYNAMIC LAYERS**

The production ambiance is a living system that responds to game state. Four layers blend based on Morale and Momentum values.

| Ambiance Layer | Morale Trigger | Momentum Trigger | Content | Mix Level |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------|-----------|
| **Positive Energy Bed** | Morale > 60 | Momentum > 60 | Crew laughter (distant), upbeat walkie chatter, equipment moving efficiently, someone humming | -26 dB, fades in over 15s |
| **Neutral Work Bed** | Morale 40-60 | Momentum 40-60 | Standard set sounds: footsteps, C-stand adjustments, tape rips, distant "Check the gate", professional efficiency | -28 dB, always present baseline |
| **Tension Bed** | Morale 25-40 | Momentum 25-40 | Quieter crew, longer pauses, terse walkie exchanges, someone sighs, footsteps are heavier | -28 dB, more space between sounds |
| **Crisis Bed** | Morale < 25 | Momentum < 25 | Near-silence on set, only essential communication, distant argument (unintelligible), equipment handled roughly, someone walks off set | -30 dB, sparse and uncomfortable |

**Dynamic mixing rule**: The four beds crossfade over 10-second windows as Morale/Momentum shift. The player should FEEL the set's energy changing before they see the numbers.

**DAILY PRODUCTION BEATS**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `slate_clap` | Clapper board clap | Start of each shoot day | Sharp transient, wood on wood, varies slightly per take (1st take = crisp, 8th take = worn). Iconic. Ritualistic |
| `director_action_distant` | "Action!" called | Scene begins (narrative moment, not every second) | Male or female voice (based on director gender), 30 feet away, slightly reverberant (warehouse/stage acoustics). Authoritative |
| `director_cut_distant` | "Cut!" called | Scene ends or crisis interrupts | Same voice, sharper tone. Sometimes frustrated, sometimes satisfied. Emotional color varies |
| `camera_dolly_roll` | Camera dolly moving on track | High-quality take in progress (Performance quality > 70) | Smooth wheels on track, slight creak, 3-6s. Hypnotic. The sound of good work happening |
| `camera_handheld_step` | Handheld camera operator footwork | Naturalistic/documentary-style scene | Footsteps, slight camera handling rustle, breathing (very quiet). Intimate, immediate |
| `lighting_adjustment` | Barn doors adjusted, C-stand moved | DP making changes (triggered during DP-related events) | Metal scrape, stand leg extension click, bulb hum change (HMI ballast) |
| `walkie_squelch_chatter` | Walkie-talkie communication | Crew coordination, every 30-90s during production | Radio squelch (sharp, 0.1s), brief garbled voice (unintelligible except tone), squelch out. Layers of production communication |
| `slate_marker_squeak` | Dry-erase marker on slate | Scene/take number update | Chisel tip squeak on whiteboard laminate, 0.4s. Incremental progress |

**CRISIS EVENT AUDIO**

Crisis events have unique audio signatures that communicate urgency and category.

| Crisis Category | Audio Signature | Design Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Talent Conflict** | Raised voices (distant, unintelligible), door slam, walkie: "Can you come to set?" | Tension without specificity. Voices are emotional tone only, never words. Door slam is heavy, final |
| **Technical Failure** | Equipment power-down sound (HMI ballast wind-down, camera jam), urgent walkie chatter, crew scrambling | Mechanical failure sounds are visceral. Sudden silence of a key tool is alarming |
| **Weather/Location** | Wind gust, rain start (exterior), distant thunder, tarp flap, panicked footsteps | Environmental hostility. Nature does not care about your schedule |
| **Creative Disagreement** | Two voices in terse exchange (mid-distance, unintelligible), long pause, footsteps walking away | Conflict is often quiet. The silence after disagreement is louder than shouting |
| **Budget Overrun** | Phone ring (production office), calculator button mashing, pen tapping on desk (anxious), "We have a problem" on walkie | Financial crisis has a specific nervousness. Numbers are being recalculated in real time |
| **Personal Crisis** | Talent trailer door slam, car door, engine start (someone leaving), walkie: "Where did they go?" | Absence is the sound. Someone is missing |
| **Opportunity (Positive)** | Excited walkie chatter, crew laughter, "We got it!" (distant), spontaneous applause (small group, 4-6 people) | Relief and triumph. Small, human, real |
| **Breakthrough** | Director: "Cut. That's the one." Long pause. Quiet crew reaction (someone whispers "Holy shit"). | Awe is quiet. The best take is followed by reverent silence, then release |

**CRISIS DECISION UI**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `crisis_alert_radio` | Urgent walkie squelch | Crisis event appears | Sharp, cuts through ambiance. Radio squelch + brief urgent tone (not a beep, a voice saying "We need you") |
| `decision_option_hover` | Subtle texture shift | Player hovers over decision option | Soft paper rustle or breath intake, barely audible. Consideration |
| `decision_commit_thud` | Decisive impact | Player selects crisis response | Depends on choice weight: minor decision = pen click, major decision = fist on table (muted, not aggressive) |
| `morale_drop_sigh` | Collective crew exhale | Morale decreases after bad decision | Group sigh (4-6 voices, distance-layered), 2s. Disappointment made audible |
| `morale_lift_energy` | Crew energy increases | Morale increases after good decision | Brief positive chatter, someone says "Alright, let's go", footsteps with purpose |

**DAILIES PLAYBACK**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `dailies_projector_start` | Film projector starts | Dailies review sequence begins | 16mm or 35mm projector motor, film threading, mechanical loop, nostalgic. Runs throughout dailies |
| `dailies_projector_stop` | Projector stops | Dailies review ends | Motor wind-down, film tail flapping (if film stock), or clean stop (if digital) |
| `dailies_reaction_positive` | Quiet approval sounds | Footage quality is high | Small murmurs of approval, someone says "Nice" or "That's great" (unintelligible but tone is clear) |
| `dailies_reaction_concern` | Quiet concern sounds | Footage quality is poor | Silence, then a sigh, or "Hmm" with worried tone. No words needed |
| `footage_scrub_analog` | Film scrubbed on flatbed | Player reviews specific scene | Mechanical film transport, variable speed (Steenbeck), sprocket holes clicking. Meditative, precise |
| `footage_scrub_digital` | Digital timeline scrub | Player reviews scene (digital workflow) | Hard drive seek noise (very quiet), timeline playhead scrub (clean, no motor) |

**PRODUCTION MOMENTUM INDICATORS**

Momentum is invisible but must be felt. Audio communicates it.

| Momentum State | Audio Treatment | Implementation |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **High (>70)** | Set ambiance is 10% faster-paced, more overlapping sounds, positive energy bed active, breakthrough events have bigger reactions | Tempo and density increase without becoming chaotic |
| **Medium (40-70)** | Baseline neutral work bed, steady rhythm, professional but not inspired | The default state. Functional |
| **Low (25-40)** | Slower ambiance, more silence between events, tension bed active, footsteps are heavier and slower | Time feels heavier. Fatigue is audible |
| **Crisis (<25)** | Sparse ambiance, long silences, only essential communication, distant stress sounds | The set is dying. Silence is the dominant texture |

**END OF PRODUCTION DAY**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `wrap_bell` | Wrap bell rings | Final shot of the day completed | Brass handbell or electric bell (depends on budget tier: low budget = handbell, high budget = electric). Three rings. Ritualistic |
| `crew_pack_up` | Equipment being packed | Day ends, transitioning to next day | Cases closing, C-stands collapsing, cables coiling, footsteps departing. 8-12s. Wind-down |
| `office_light_off` | Office light switch off | Player leaves production day UI | Old light switch, electric hum fades, slight echo. Day is done |

**WRAP PARTY (Production Complete)**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `wrap_party_ambiance` | Bar/restaurant ambiance | Production wraps successfully | Crowd chatter (20-30 people), glasses clinking, laughter, diegetic music on bar stereo (muffled indie rock or jazz). Warm, relieved energy. 30-60s duration |
| `toast_clink` | Glasses clink | Morale > 60 at wrap | Beer bottles or whiskey glasses, 3-5 clinks, layered. Celebration |
| `wrap_party_quiet` | Subdued gathering | Morale < 40 at wrap | Sparse conversation, no music, people leaving early. The relief of ending, not the joy of success |

**AMBIANCE BED — PRODUCTION PHASE SUMMARY**

Production ambiance is the most complex system in BACKLOT's audio. It must:
- Communicate morale and momentum without UI (audio is the UI)
- Respond dynamically to player decisions in near-real-time (10s crossfade windows)
- Provide rhythmic punctuation (slate claps, walkie squelch) without becoming repetitive (randomized pools of 12-20 variations per sound)
- Balance density (set is busy) with clarity (player must hear crisis alerts and key reactions)

**Silence map**: Production has the LEAST silence of any phase, except for one critical moment: when the director says "Cut. That's the one." After a breakthrough take, there is 3-4 seconds of near-total silence (ambiance drops to -45 dB) before the crew reacts. That silence is reverence. It is the sound of something great being captured.

---

### 3.4 THE AVID BAY (Post-Production Phase)

**Core player verbs: SHAPE, CUT, REFINE**

Post-production is surgical. The chaos of production is over. Now it is footage, timeline, decisions about shape. This is a quieter space, but no less tense.

**EDITING SUITE AMBIANCE**

| Layer | Content | Mix Level | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Base room tone | Small room, HVAC hum, computer fan (higher pitch than office — 240 Hz) | -34 dB | Enclosed space, focused work |
| Equipment layer | Hard drive seek sounds (quiet ticks every 15-30s), monitor hum, keyboard (softer than mechanical — membrane keys) | -36 dB | Digital editing era, not film cutting |
| Editor presence | Occasional mouse click, chair creak, editor's breath (very subtle, when player is idle), coffee sip | -38 dB | The editor is there. The player is collaborating, not alone |

**EDITING INTERFACE SOUNDS**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `scene_card_select` | Scene card clicked | Player selects scene to review | Digital card tap, like a trackpad click but with slight paper texture (hybrid physical/digital). 0.2s |
| `scene_card_drag` | Scene card dragged | Player rearranges timeline order | Soft drag, slight resistance, 0.4-1.5s depending on drag distance |
| `timeline_snap` | Scene card snaps into timeline | Card placed in sequence | Magnetic snap, clean, satisfying. Slightly lower pitch than casting snap (this is more cerebral, less social) |
| `timeline_scrub` | Playhead scrubbed across timeline | Player reviews sequence | Digital scrub sound, hard drive seek layer, subtle. Speed varies with scrub speed |
| `playback_start` | Timeline playback begins | Player watches sequence | Keyboard spacebar tap + digital play "beep" (Avid-style), footage starts |
| `playback_stop` | Timeline playback stops | Player stops sequence | Keyboard spacebar tap + clean stop. No beep |
| `quality_meter_rise` | Quality axis bar increases | Scene quality evaluated positively | Soft sine tone rise (pitch up 200 Hz to 400 Hz over 0.8s), very quiet. Positive feedback |
| `quality_meter_drop` | Quality axis bar decreases | Scene quality evaluated negatively | Pitch drop (400 Hz to 200 Hz over 0.8s), slight detuning. Concern without alarm |

**EDITORIAL APPROACH SELECTION**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `approach_hover` | Editorial approach option hovered | Player considers approach | Subtle pad swell, different timbre per approach: Tight & Propulsive = bright, Slow & Meditative = warm and low, Nonlinear = slightly dissonant, Montage-Heavy = rhythmic pulse, Naturalistic = organic texture |
| `approach_select` | Editorial approach chosen | Player commits to approach | Keyboard return key + brief musical phrase (2-3 notes) that matches the approach's aesthetic. Tight = staccato, Slow = legato, etc. 1.5s |
| `editor_nod_approval` | Editor approves choice | Editor with high Skill agrees with player choice | Quiet "Mm" or chair creak (editor leans back, satisfied). Validation |
| `editor_concern_hmm` | Editor has reservations | Editor with high Skill disagrees with player choice | Slight "Hmm" with questioning tone, or pen tapping on desk. Not refusal, just doubt |

**SCORING & COLOR GRADING LAYERS**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `score_preview_play` | Composer demo plays | Player auditions score for film | Diegetic playback from laptop speakers (bandpass filter 200-8000 Hz, slight speaker distortion). Music style matches composer's profile and film genre. 15-30s snippet |
| `score_approve` | Score approved | Player locks in score | Mouse click + brief sustain of score's final note (0.8s decay). Integration |
| `color_grade_shift` | Visual tone shift sound | Player applies color grade | Subtle textural shift — warmer grades have lower frequency presence (80 Hz pad), colder grades have higher frequency shimmer (6-8 kHz). 2s crossfade. Synesthetic sound design |
| `final_render_export` | Film rendering | Post-production completes | Progress bar sounds: hard drive activity (ticking, seeking), render percentage ticks (every 10%), completion beep. 8-15s compressed time. Anticipation |

**ROUGH CUT SCREENING**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `screening_room_door` | Door to screening room opens | Rough cut screening begins | Heavy door, pressure seal release (theater-grade door), footsteps on carpet, door closes with weight. 4s |
| `seat_sit` | Player sits in screening room | Screening setup | Theater seat cushion compress, slight creak, settling |
| `house_lights_dim` | Lights dim | Screening about to start | Electrical hum fading down (transformer wind-down), 3s. Darkness is audible |
| `rough_cut_projector` | Digital projector starts | Film plays | Modern DLP projector fan hum (constant, 180 Hz), not film rattle. Clean, digital, 2006-era |
| `rough_cut_reaction_self` | Player's own reaction sounds | During screening (based on quality score) | Breathing patterns change: high quality = held breath, slow exhale; low quality = anxious shifting, faster breathing. Subtle, subliminal |
| `rough_cut_end_silence` | Silence after film ends | Film completes | 4-6 seconds of pure silence. No applause. Just the player and the film. Then: |
| `house_lights_up` | Lights come up | Screening ends | Electrical hum rising, 2s. Return to reality |

**AMBIANCE BED — AVID BAY PHASE**

Post-production is the quietest phase. The soundscape is intimate, focused, cerebral.

| Layer | Content | Mix Level | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Base | Small room tone, computer hum, hard drive ticks | -34 dB | Constant, meditative |
| Editor presence | Breathing, chair creaks, occasional mouse click, coffee sip | -38 dB | Collaboration. You are not editing alone |
| Diegetic music layer | If score is being auditioned, laptop playback bleeds into ambiance | -32 dB | Music enters the world diegetically |

**Silence map**: The rough cut screening has the most significant silence in the entire game. After the film ends, there is 4-6 seconds of total silence (all ambiance at -60 dB, effectively muted). The player sits with what they have made. No music. No reaction. Just silence and the question: "Is this good?" Then the lights come up.

### 3.5 THE FESTIVAL CIRCUIT (Release Phase)

**Core player verbs: STRATEGIZE, SUBMIT, REACT**

This is public judgment. The sound design must communicate anticipation, collective breath-holding, and the binary of triumph or devastation.

**FESTIVAL SUBMISSION**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `festival_brochure_open` | Festival brochure opened | Player reviews festival options | Glossy paper unfold, heavier stock than script, 0.8s |
| `submission_form_type` | Form fields filled | Player enters submission details | Keyboard typing (mechanical, 3-6s), period-appropriate (online forms existed but felt clunky) |
| `submission_fee_charge` | Credit card charged | Submission fee paid | Card swipe (magnetic stripe, mid-2000s), brief processing beep, receipt printer (thermal paper). Transactional, costly |
| `submission_email_send` | Submission email sent | Submission complete | Email whoosh (classic outbox sound), 0.4s. The die is cast |

**FESTIVAL NOTIFICATION**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `festival_email_arrive` | Email notification sound | Festival acceptance/rejection arrives | Email notification chime (positive for acceptance, neutral for rejection), inbox count ding |
| `acceptance_letter_open` | Acceptance email opened | Player reads acceptance | Mouse click, email loads, brief pause, then: |
| `acceptance_reaction_breath` | Sharp intake of breath | Festival accepts film | Player character's breath (sharp inhale, 0.6s). Relief and terror simultaneously |
| `rejection_letter_open` | Rejection email opened | Player reads rejection | Same mouse click, email loads, silence. No reaction sound. The absence is the sound |

**FESTIVAL ARRIVAL & THEATER APPROACH**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `festival_city_ambiance` | Exterior city sound | Festival sequence begins | Depends on festival: Sundance = snow crunch footsteps, cold wind; Cannes = seagulls, French chatter; Toronto = urban traffic, multicultural voices. 20s |
| `festival_crowd_exterior` | Festival-goers outside venue | Approaching theater | Crowd murmur (50-100 people), multiple languages, camera shutters (press), excitement and nerves. 15s |
| `theater_entrance_door` | Theater entrance door | Player enters theater | Heavy door, red carpet footsteps (muffled, plush), crowd noise shifts from exterior to interior acoustic, door closes behind (muffled exterior noise) |
| `lobby_ambiance` | Theater lobby | Pre-screening lobby | Champagne glasses,ProgessiveConversation murmur (industry voices — agents, critics, other filmmakers), anticipation |

**THEATER INTERIOR & SEATING**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `theater_door_interior` | Auditorium door opens | Entering theater proper | Pressure seal, light spill reverb (large room acoustic revealed), door closes with weight. 3s |
| `audience_pre_show_murmur` | Audience settling | Theater filling | 200-500 people (depends on festival tier), program pages rustling, seat creaks, coats rustling, conversation murmur. Energy is high but contained. Reverb tail: 2.8s (large theater) |
| `seat_selection_walk` | Walking down aisle to seat | Player moves to seat | Carpet footsteps, "excuse me" murmurs (unintelligible), apology/acknowledgment tones, seat flipping up, sitting down (cushion compress). 8-12s. Ritual |
| `neighbor_greeting` | Person next to player speaks | Seated, pre-show | Muffled voice (friendly tone, unintelligible words), player's response (single "Yeah" or "Thanks"), return to silence. Human contact before judgment |

**THE LIGHTS GO DOWN**

This is the single most important audio moment in BACKLOT. This is where everything the player has done leads.

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `house_lights_dim_festival` | Theater lights dim | Screening begins | Electrical transformer wind-down, 4s. Audience murmur fades naturally (people stop talking as lights drop). By the end of the dim, near-total silence |
| `audience_hush` | Final pre-screening silence | Lights fully down, before projector starts | 2-3 seconds of held breath. 400 people in total silence. Reverent. Terrifying |
| `projector_start_festival` | Projector starts | Film begins | Modern DLP projector (quiet, professional), slight fan hum. The film is running |
| `film_title_appear` | Film's title card appears on screen | First frame of player's film | Silence. Then, after 1.5s, a single audience member shifts in their seat. The screening has begun |

**AUDIENCE REACTION SYSTEM (Dynamic)**

The audience reacts in real time based on the film's Festival_Score calculation. The player HEARS the reception before they see the score.

| Reception Tier | Audio Design | Triggered When | Duration |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| **Walkout/Pan** |席rustling begins at 30% into screening, footsteps (aggressive, not subtle), multiple walkouts (every 10-15s), whispered criticism (unintelligible but tone is clear: dismissive), by 60% through screening, 30% of audience is gone. Remaining audience is silent. | Festival_Score < 20th percentile | Throughout 90s screening |
| **Cold Reception** | Minimal reaction. No laughter at intended moments, no gasps, no emotional sounds. Audience is present but unengaged. Occasional cough, program rustle, watch check. | Festival_Score 20th-30th percentile | Throughout screening |
| **Mixed Reception** | Some positive reactions (quiet laughter, couple of emotional exhales) but also dead spots. Inconsistent. Half the audience is engaged, half is polite. | Festival_Score 40th-70th percentile | Throughout screening |
| **Positive Reception** | Consistent engagement. Laughter at intended moments, collective gasps, emotional beats land (audience breath shifts). No walkouts. Energy is present but controlled. | Festival_Score 70th-85th percentile | Throughout screening |
| **Enthusiastic Reception** | Strong engagement. Laughter is louder, gasps are audible, someone whispers "Wow". Emotional peaks trigger audience emotional sounds (quiet crying, held breath). | Festival_Score 85th-95th percentile | Throughout screening |
| **Standing Ovation** | Explosive engagement. Audience reacts viscerally throughout. At film's end: 2 seconds of silence, then applause begins (slow clap starts, builds rapidly, entire audience standing by 8s). Applause sustains for 30-90s (duration based on exact score). Some cheers, whistles. | Festival_Score > 95th percentile | Screening + 30-90s post-credits |

**END CREDITS & IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `credits_roll_silence` | Silence before reaction | Film ends, before applause/walkout | 1.5-3s depending on reception tier. Walkout tier = 0.5s (people leave immediately). Ovation tier = 3s (reverent silence before explosion) |
| `applause_polite` | Polite applause | Mixed/Positive reception | 8-12s, moderate density (60% of audience clapping), fades naturally. Respectful but not passionate |
| `applause_strong` | Strong applause | Enthusiastic reception | 15-25s, high density (90% of audience), some whistles, "Bravo!" shouts (distant). Genuine appreciation |
| `applause_standing_ovation` | Standing ovation | Top 5% reception | 30-90s duration, builds from slow clap to full audience, standing (chair creaks as people rise), sustained, some cheering, a few people shouting director's name. TRIUMPH. This is the highest high in BACKLOT |
| `walkout_footsteps` | Audience leaving during film | Walkout/Pan reception | Footsteps (multiple), seat flips, door opens (light and sound spill, exterior lobby noise), door closes. Repeated every 10-15s. Each walkout is a wound |
| `post_screening_murmur` | Audience exiting | After credits end | Conversation restarts, program rustle, coats, footsteps up aisle, door opens repeatedly. Tone matches reception: excited chatter (positive) or muted/critical (negative) |

**AWARDS CEREMONY**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `ceremony_ambiance` | Awards ceremony crowd | Ceremony begins | 400-800 people (depends on festival), formal attire rustle, anticipation, multilingual murmur. Larger room reverb (3.5s tail) |
| `ceremony_host_mic` | Host speaks | Announcing awards | Microphone proximity effect, clear speech (unintelligible words but authoritative tone), audience quiets |
| `envelope_open` | Envelope opened | Award about to be announced | Paper tear (clean, deliberate), pause. Tension |
| `award_announcement_pause` | Pause before name | Host about to read winner | 1.5-2s of total silence. 600 people holding breath |
| `award_winner_OTHER` | Another film wins | Player's film did not win | Name read (unintelligible), applause (player is in audience, hears it from inside the loss), winner walks to stage (distant footsteps). The player is invisible |
| `award_winner_PLAYER` | Player's film wins | Player wins award | Name read, beat of shock (0.8s silence as player processes), then applause (close, immediate, surrounding). Chair creak as player stands, footsteps to stage (close perspective, reverb grows), handshake, award weight in hands (slight handling rustle), return to seat. VALIDATION |
| `trophy_weight` | Trophy held | Player holds award | Metal and marble weight, slight shift in hands, substantive. Physical proof |

**FESTIVAL RESULTS SCREEN**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| `press_quote_appear` | Press quote text appears | Review quotes display | Typewriter sound (single line, 1.5s) or digital text render. Period-appropriate |
| `distribution_offer_arrive` | Distribution offer notification | Distributor expresses interest | Email chime or phone buzz, depending on offer quality (high offer = phone call, low offer = email) |
| `revenue_projection_calculate` | Revenue numbers update | Financial projections appear | Calculator button beeps (rapid sequence), total locks in with satisfying click |

**AMBIANCE BED — FESTIVAL PHASE**

| Location | Ambiance Content | Mix Level | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Festival Exterior** | City ambiance + festival crowd + press activity | -26 dB | High energy, public, exposed |
| **Theater Lobby** | Crowd murmur, glasses, conversation, anticipation | -28 dB | Contained energy, social |
| **Theater Interior (pre-screening)** | Audience settling, program rustle, seat creaks, murmur | -30 dB | Anticipation, collective |
| **Theater Interior (screening)** | Audience reactions (dynamic based on reception), projector hum | -32 to -24 dB (varies) | Audience IS the soundscape |
| **Awards Ceremony** | Formal crowd, anticipation, applause (triggered) | -28 dB | Ritualistic, high stakes |

**Silence map**: The festival phase has TWO critical silences:
1. **Lights down, before projector starts**: 2-3 seconds of 400 people in total silence. The moment before the film begins.
2. **Film ends, before reaction**: 1.5-3 seconds of silence before applause or walkout. The moment of judgment.

These silences are not empty. They are full of every decision the player has made. Silence is the sound of consequence arriving.

### 3.6 THE LEDGER (Financial System)

**Core player verbs: BUDGET, INVEST, SURVIVE**

The Ledger is diegetic interface. It is a CRT monitor running spreadsheet software. It is a calculator. It is paper statements. Audio must communicate financial health and crisis without abstraction.

**LEDGER INTERFACE**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `crt_monitor_on` | CRT powers on | Ledger opened | CRT degaussing sound (magnetic coil), 1.2s, screen hum starts (15750 Hz horizontal refresh, very quiet but present). Nostalgia and precision |

| `budget_total_update` | Total recalculates | Budget changes trigger total update | Brief calculation sound (digital processing, 0.4s), new total appears with subtle ding (pitch indicates health: high pitch = positive, low pitch = negative) |
| `print_budget_report` | Budget printed | Player prints budget for production | Dot-matrix printer (period-accurate, 6-10s), paper tear-off at end. Physical artifact generated |

**FINANCIAL ALERTS**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `low_cash_warning` | Cash below threshold | Cash < $100K | Calculator beep (two-tone, questioning), spreadsheet cell turns red (subtle UI rustle). Warning, not alarm |
| `critical_cash_alert` | Cash critically low | Cash < $50K | Harsher beep (three tones, descending), phone starts ringing (in background, insistent). Crisis is arriving |
| `credit_line_tap` | Credit line drawn | Player uses credit | Calculator sequence, then printer receipt (thermal paper, 3s). Borrowing has a sound. Interest is silent but will be heard later |
| `bankruptcy_warning` | Bankruptcy imminent | Cash $0, credit maxed, 3 months to crisis | Phone ringing (will not stop until answered), calculator beeping (error tone), spreadsheet shows negative numbers. ALARM |

**REVENUE ARRIVAL**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `check_arrive_mail` | Check arrives by mail | Revenue payment arrives | Mailbox open (metal creak), envelope pull, envelope tear, check rustle. 4s. Physical money in the mid-2000s |
| `check_deposit_write` | Check endorsed | Player deposits check | Pen on check (signature), 1.2s |
| `bank_deposit_process` | Deposit processes | Cash increases | Calculator entry, brief processing, spreadsheet total updates (upward ding, satisfying). Green number appears |
| `revenue_large_celebration` | Significant revenue arrives | Revenue > $200K | Brief positive musical phrase (2-3 notes, warm timbre), not a sound effect. Rare. This matters |

**INVESTOR & GRANT INTERACTIONS**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `investor_call_ring` | Investor calls | Investor interest triggered | Phone ring (two-tone, professional), must be answered |
| `investor_voice` | Investor speaks | During investor negotiation | Phone-filtered voice (bandpass 300-3000 Hz), businessman tone (confident, transactional), unintelligible words but clear intent: money with strings |
| `contract_sign_investor` | Investment contract signed | Player accepts investor deal | Pen signature (heavier paper, more formal than talent contract), 2.5s. Binding |
| `grant_application_submit` | Grant application submitted | Player applies for grant | Form pages stapled (manual stapler, 3-4 staples), envelope stuffed, mail drop. Old-fashioned process |
| `grant_award_letter` | Grant awarded | Grant application succeeds | Letterhead envelope open, thick paper unfold, moment of reading (silence, 2s), relieved exhale. Salvation without compromise |

**FINANCIAL CRISIS STATE**

| SFX Name | Description | Trigger | Audio Design Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| `crisis_state_ambiance` | Office during financial crisis | Crisis State active | Base office ambiance is quieter (people are worried), phone rings more often (creditors), calculator used constantly (background anxiety), less conversation. The air is different |
| `creditor_call_insistent` | Creditor calling | Crisis State, every 60-120s | Phone ring (harsher tone, more insistent), if not answered, rings again. Pressure is audible |
| `emergency_grant_arrive` | Emergency grant approved | One-time lifeline triggered | Email chime (positive), letter open, sharp inhale (relief), 4s. Rare. This is a second chance |

**AMBIANCE BED — LEDGER INTERACTIONS**

The Ledger is not a separate phase but a constant presence. It is checked between phases, during decision moments, when the player is anxious.

| Layer | Content | Mix Level | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Base | Same office ambiance as Greenlight phase | -32 dB | Consistency. The Ledger is part of the office |
| Calculator layer | Calculator button sounds (when player is actively budgeting) | -30 dB | Anxiety made audible. Math is survival |
| Phone layer (crisis) | Phone ringing more frequently if cash is low | -28 dB | Pressure from outside |

**Silence map**: When the player's cash total updates after a major revenue arrival or major budget expenditure, there is a 1.5s pause before the new number appears. The calculation is happening. The player is waiting. Silence is anticipation.

---

## 4. Music Design

### 4.1 Music Philosophy

Music in BACKLOT is sparse, diegetically-motivated, and emotionally precise. There is no constant background score. Music appears when:
1. The player is in a menu/title screen (non-diegetic, sets tone)
2. The player is experiencing a high-stakes emotional moment (festival premiere, awards ceremony, breakthrough production moment)
3. Music is playing diegetically in the world (temp tracks in editing suite, score demos, radio in office)

The rule: if the player cannot identify WHERE the music is coming from, it should not be there. The exception: title/menu music and rare peak emotional moments (standing ovation, bankruptcy, studio closure).

### 4.2 Core Musical Themes

**MAIN THEME — "The Greenlight Table"**
- **Instrumentation**: Solo fingerstyle acoustic guitar (nylon string)
- **Tempo**: 72 BPM
- **Key**: D minor
- **Character**: Warm, slightly melancholic, hopeful without being naive. The sound of someone believing in something fragile
- **Duration**: 2:30 loop
- **Usage**: Title screen, main menu, year-end review screen
- **Arrangement**: Simple fingerpicking pattern, open tunings, occasional harmonics. No percussion. Just the guitar and the space around it
- **Emotional arc**: Begins tentative (single-note melody), builds to fuller chords (hope), returns to sparse melody (the cycle continues)
- **Reference**: José González — "Crosses", Dustin O'Halloran — "Opus 23"

**PRODUCTION BREAKTHROUGH THEME — "The Take"**
- **Instrumentation**: Prepared piano + subtle string pad
- **Tempo**: Free tempo, rubato
- **Key**: A major (warm, triumphant without bombast)
- **Character**: Awe, relief, the moment when something real is captured
- **Duration**: 12-15s (triggered moment, not loop)
- **Usage**: Breakthrough event during production (Performance + Cinematography + Emotional Impact all > 80)
- **Arrangement**: Single piano note (prepared with felt, muted attack), held, then slow upward melodic phrase (4 notes), string pad swells underneath (very quiet), resolves on tonic. Silence after
- **Emotional arc**: Stillness -> recognition -> quiet triumph -> silence
- **Reference**: Jóhann Jóhannsson — "A Song for Europa"

**FESTIVAL PREMIERE THEME — "The Lights Go Down"**
- **Instrumentation**: String quartet (2 violins, viola, cello)
- **Tempo**: 60 BPM
- **Key**: E minor
- **Character**: Anticipation, vulnerability, collective breath
- **Duration**: 45-60s (plays during theater approach and seating)
- **Usage**: Festival premiere sequence, from entering theater to lights dimming
- **Arrangement**: Quiet sustained tones (ppp), slow harmonic movement, dissonant intervals (minor seconds) creating tension, never resolves fully — music stops when lights go down, leaving the player in silence before the screening
- **Emotional arc**: Anticipation -> mounting tension -> (silence is the resolution)
- **Reference**: Arvo Pärt — "Spiegel im Spiegel", Max Richter — "On the Nature of Daylight" (tension, not beauty)

**STANDING OVATION THEME — "Vindication"**
- **Instrumentation**: Full arrangement: acoustic guitar + piano + strings + subtle analog synth pad
- **Tempo**: 84 BPM
- **Key**: C major (rare major key moment in BACKLOT)
- **Character**: Triumph, earned joy, the release of held breath
- **Duration**: 90s (plays during ovation and immediate aftermath)
- **Usage**: Standing ovation (>95th percentile reception)
- **Arrangement**: Begins with solo piano (simple melody, major key, unashamed), guitar enters with fingerpicking (12s), strings swell (20s), builds to full texture (40s), sustains with variation, slowly fades as player exits theater. This is the highest emotional peak in the game — the music is allowed to be beautiful
- **Emotional arc**: Recognition -> joy -> overwhelming gratitude -> gentle return to reality
- **Reference**: Explosions in the Sky — "Your Hand in Mine", Ólafur Arnalds — "Only the Winds"

**BANKRUPTCY THEME — "The Lights Go Out"**
- **Instrumentation**: Solo piano (no preparation, dry and stark)
- **Tempo**: 52 BPM
- **Key**: G minor
- **Character**: Finality, loss, the end of something
- **Duration**: 60s (plays during bankruptcy sequence)
- **Usage**: Studio closes due to bankruptcy
- **Arrangement**: Sparse descending melody, low register, long pauses between phrases, ends on unresolved note (no tonic). The music does not provide closure because there is none
- **Emotional arc**: Realization -> acceptance -> unresolved ending
- **Reference**: Max Richter — "November", Philip Glass — "Metamorphosis Two"

### 4.3 Adaptive Music System (Diegetic Temp Music)

During the Avid Bay phase, the player hears temp music playing from the editing suite's laptop speakers. This music is procedurally selected based on the film's genre and tone attributes.

**Genre-Specific Temp Music Palette** (each genre has 8-12 tracks in pool):

| Film Genre | Temp Music Style | Instrumentation | Example Reference |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Drama | Indie folk, chamber music | Acoustic guitar, strings, minimal piano | Iron & Wine, Nick Drake |
| Comedy | Playful indie rock, quirky acoustic | Guitar, glockenspiel, light percussion | Juno soundtrack, Belle & Sebastian |
| Thriller | Tense minimalism, dark ambient | Synth pads, sparse piano, pulse | Cliff Martinez, Trent Reznor |
| Horror | Dissonant strings, dark drones | Prepared strings, analog synth, noise | Krzysztof Penderecki, Ben Frost |
| Doc-Hybrid | Contemplative ambient, field recordings | Piano + environmental textures | Nils Frahm, Hauschka |
| Experimental | Abstract electronica, modern classical | Glitch, prepared instruments, silence | Alva Noto, Ryuichi Sakamoto |

**Temp music playback characteristics**:
- Bandpass filter: 200-8000 Hz (laptop speaker simulation)
- Slight digital compression artifact (2006-era MP3 playback)
- Mix level: -30 dB when playing, player can "turn it down" (drops to -42 dB) or "turn it up" (raises to -24 dB)
- Duration: Plays in 30-90s loops while player is in Avid Bay
- Selection: Weighted by film's Tone attribute (light tone = brighter music, heavy tone = darker music)

### 4.4 Music Implementation Strategy

**Interactive Music Layers** (for festival sequence):

The Festival Premiere Theme has three layers that dynamically crossfade based on player proximity to screening:

| Layer | Content | When Active | Mix Level |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Layer 1: Approach** | Full string quartet, tense harmony | Player in festival exterior/lobby | -28 dB |
| **Layer 2: Threshold** | Viola + cello only, lower register | Player entering theater, walking to seat | -30 dB |
| **Layer 3: Imminent** | Solo cello, sustained single note | Player seated, lights beginning to dim | -32 dB, fades to silence as lights complete dimming |

**Music Mixing Rules**:
- Music never plays at the same time as critical dialogue or crisis alerts (auto-duck to -45 dB when crisis event triggers)
- Menu music fades out over 3s when player starts a session (world ambiance fades in simultaneously)
- Diegetic temp music respects the player's "volume" control (if player turns it down, it stays down until player changes it)
- Emotional peak music (Breakthrough, Ovation, Bankruptcy) takes priority over all ambiance (ambiance dips to -42 dB)

### 4.5 Silence as Music

The most important "music" in BACKLOT is the absence of it. Silence is used structurally:

| Moment | Duration | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| After greenlight stamp | 2s | Let the decision land |
| Before "Action!" on set | 1.5s | Anticipation before creation |
| After breakthrough take | 4s | Awe before release |
| Rough cut screening ends | 4-6s | Player sits with their film |
| Festival lights down, before projector | 2-3s | 400 people holding breath |
| Film ends, before reaction | 1.5-3s | Judgment arriving |
| Between bankruptcy notice and theme | 3s | Realization before music |

These silences are not gaps. They are composed. They are timed. They are the sound of consequence, of breath held, of the space between what was and what is about to be.

---

## 5. Adaptive Audio System Design

### 5.1 Game State -> Audio State Mapping

BACKLOT's audio is deeply reactive to game state. The soundscape is not decorative — it is informational. The player should be able to close their eyes and know: what phase am I in, how is production going, how does the studio feel.

**Primary Game State Variables Affecting Audio**:

| Game Variable | Audio System Affected | How It Affects Audio |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Current Phase** | Ambiance bed, available SFX pool, music eligibility | Each phase has distinct ambiance (office vs set vs theater) |
| **Morale** (0-100) | Production ambiance energy, crew reaction sounds | High morale = positive energy bed, low morale = tension/crisis bed |
| **Momentum** (0-100) | Production ambiance tempo, breakthrough event probability | High momentum = faster-paced ambiance, low = sluggish, sparse |
| **Reputation** (0-100) | Office ambiance detail, phone frequency, agent tone | High reputation = more phone calls (opportunity), professional office sounds |
| **Cash** ($) | Ledger alert frequency, office anxiety level | Low cash = more calculator sounds, more phone rings (creditors), tense ambiance |
| **Artistic Identity** (-100 to +100, commercial to auteur) | Office ambiance character | Commercial = brighter, busier; Auteur = quieter, more contemplative |
| **Festival Reception Tier** | Audience reaction sounds, music triggers | Directly maps to reception audio (walkout to ovation) |
| **Relationship Scores** | Talent negotiation voice tone, chemistry indicators | High relationship = friendlier agent voice, positive chimes |

### 5.2 Dynamic Mixing System

BACKLOT employs a priority-based adaptive mixing system with 8 mix channels:

| Channel | Priority | Content | Base Level | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|------------|-------|
| **1. Critical Alerts** | Highest | Crisis events, phone rings, urgent walkies | -20 dB | Always audible, ducks everything else by -8 dB |
| **2. Player Actions** | High | Direct player SFX (clicks, drags, stamps, signatures) | -22 dB | Immediate feedback, ducks ambiance by -4 dB |
| **3. Dialogue/Voice** | High | Agent voices, director calls, mentor, festival announcer | -24 dB | Ducks ambiance by -6 dB, music by -10 dB |
| **4. Music** | Medium-High | All music (menu, emotional peaks, diegetic temp) | -28 dB (varies) | Auto-ducks for critical alerts and dialogue |
| **5. Key Reactions** | Medium | Audience reactions, crew reactions, talent responses | -26 dB | Informational, should be clear |
| **6. Detail SFX** | Medium-Low | Secondary sounds (paper, footsteps, equipment) | -32 dB | Texture, not information |
| **7. Ambiance Bed** | Low | Phase-specific ambiance (office, set, theater) | -32 dB | Foundation, constant |
| **8. Environmental Distance** | Lowest | Distant traffic, far rooms, background city | -36 dB | World-building, barely conscious |

**Auto-Ducking Rules**:
- When Channel 1 (Critical Alerts) triggers, Channels 4-8 duck by -8 dB over 0.3s
- When Channel 3 (Dialogue/Voice) triggers, Channels 4, 6, 7, 8 duck by -6 dB over 0.5s
- When Music (Channel 4) plays, Ambiance (Channel 7) ducks by -4 dB over 2s (gentle, not jarring)
- Player Actions (Channel 2) are always audible with no ducking delay

### 5.3 Procedural Audio Elements

Certain sounds in BACKLOT are procedurally generated or modified to avoid repetition and increase realism.

**PROCEDURAL SYSTEMS**:

**1. Phone Ring Timing**
- Base frequency: Every 90-180s (random)
- Modified by: Reputation (higher = more calls), Cash (lower = more creditor calls), Crisis State (every 60-90s)
- Ring count: 2-4 rings before stopping
- If player clicks on phone (optional interaction), brief muffled conversation plays, then hangup

**2. Crew Chatter Generation**
- Pool of 40 voice snippets (unintelligible, various tones: question, statement, laughter, concern)
- Selected based on Morale state, layered with 2-4 voices simultaneously at varying distances (15-50 feet)
- Randomized timing: Every 20-45s, one snippet plays
- Avoids same snippet twice in 180s window

**3. Paper Shuffle Variations**
- 12 recorded variations of paper shuffling (different paper types, quantities, speeds)
- Selected randomly with weighting: script pages (common), contracts (less common), coverage reports (common)
- Pitch-shifted ±5% randomly to increase perceived variation pool to 24

**4. Footstep System**
- Material types: Concrete (set floor), wood (office floor), carpet (theater)
- Weight classes: Light (PA, nervous actor), medium (crew, player character), heavy (grip with equipment)
- Pace: Slow (1.2s interval), normal (0.8s interval), fast (0.5s interval)
- Procedurally generated from 8 base samples per material, pitch-shifted and timing-varied
- Distance: Close (player), mid (10-20 feet), far (30+ feet), affects mix level and reverb

**5. Audience Reaction Synthesis**
- Standing Ovation applause is layered system:
  - Layer 1: 60 individual clap samples, randomized timing (10-18 claps per second per person)
  - Layer 2: 200 "people" (simulated), each with randomized start time (builds from slow clap)
  - Layer 3: Whistles (3-6 instances), cheers (8-12 instances), "Bravo!" shouts (2-4 instances)
  - Layer 4: Chair creaks (200 instances over 6-8s as people stand)
  - Total duration: 30-90s, intensity based on exact Festival_Score percentile
- Walkout footsteps: Similar system but subtractive (audience shrinks over time), 8-20 walkout events

**6. Ambiance Bed Evolution**
- Office ambiance has 6 time-of-day variants:
  - Morning (8am-11am): Coffee maker active, more energetic typing, fresh
  - Midday (11am-3pm): Phones more frequent, lunch sounds (distant), steady
  - Afternoon (3pm-6pm): Baseline, most neutral
  - Evening (6pm-9pm): Fewer phones, quieter typing, contemplative
  - Night (9pm-12am): Minimal activity, single desk lamp hum, solitary
  - Late night (12am-6am): Near-silent, distant city only, player is alone
- Crossfades over 30s when time-of-day advances

### 5.4 Spatial Audio Design

BACKLOT uses 2.0 stereo with simulated 3D space through volume, panning, and reverb.

**SPATIAL ZONES**:

| Space Type | Reverb Profile | Distance Cues | Panning Strategy |
|------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Office (small room)** | RT60: 0.4s, small room IR | Volume rolloff: -6 dB per doubling distance | Narrow stereo field (±30°), player is center |
| **Production Set (warehouse)** | RT60: 2.2s, large reflective space IR | Volume rolloff: -4 dB per doubling distance | Wide stereo field (±90°), dynamic based on camera position |
| **Theater (large auditorium)** | RT60: 2.8s, concert hall IR | Volume rolloff: -3 dB per doubling distance | Immersive field (±110°), audience surrounds player |
| **Exterior (festival street)** | No reverb, environmental scatter | Volume rolloff: -5 dB per doubling distance | Full stereo field (±180°), city bleeds from all directions |

**DISTANCE LAYERS** (all sounds are categorized):
- **Intimate (0-3 feet)**: Player's own actions, papers on desk, keyboard, mouse clicks. No reverb. Dry. Immediate
- **Close (3-10 feet)**: Conversations across desk, nearby phone, adjacent equipment. Light reverb (10% wet). Present
- **Mid (10-30 feet)**: Crew on set, other desks in office, theater neighbors. Medium reverb (30% wet). Contextual
- **Far (30-100 feet)**: Distant set activity, other side of theater, festival crowd. Heavy reverb (50% wet). Environmental
- **Distant (100+ feet)**: City traffic, far rooms, exterior ambiance. Reverb + low-pass filter (rolls off above 4kHz). Subliminal

**PANNING SYSTEM**:
- Player character is always center (0° pan)
- Sounds are positioned in stereo field based on their implied spatial location:
  - Phone on desk: 20° right (arbitrary but consistent)
  - Cork board: 45° left
  - Computer monitor: 10° right
  - Door to office: 70° left
  - Window (traffic sounds): 60° right
- Positions are consistent throughout game — the office has spatial memory, the player learns where things are sonically

### 5.5 Dialogue System (Voice Fragments)

BACKLOT has NO fully intelligible dialogue. All voices are emotional tone and cadence only. This is deliberate — the player projects meaning onto tone.

**VOICE RECORDING SPECS**:
- All voices recorded with neutral "corporate" mic technique (Shure SM7B or equivalent, cardioid, 6-inch distance)
- Processing: Phone voices bandpass 300-3000 Hz + slight saturation (vintage phone effect); in-person voices natural EQ
- No reverb in recording, added in-engine based on spatial position
- Performances: Actors given emotional direction, not words. "Sound grateful but nervous." "Sound like you're asking for a favor." "Sound like you're delivering bad news"

**VOICE CATEGORIES & POOL SIZES**:

| Voice Type | Emotional Range | Pool Size | Duration per Snippet | Usage |
|------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Agent (phone)** | Friendly, neutral, curt, aggressive | 16 snippets (4 emotions × 4 variations) | 4-8s | Talent negotiation |
| **Director (on set)** | Authoritative, frustrated, satisfied, excited | 12 snippets | 2-5s | Production calls |
| **Crew Chatter** | Question, statement, laughter, concern | 40 snippets | 1-3s | Set/office ambiance |
| **Mentor NPC** | Supportive, advisory, concerned | 8 snippets | 8-15s | Mentorship events |
| **Festival Announcer** | Formal, anticipatory | 6 snippets | 3-6s | Awards ceremony |
| **Investor** | Confident, transactional, impatient | 8 snippets | 5-10s | Investment negotiation |
| **Press/Critics (distant)** | Excited, dismissive, analytical | 12 snippets | 2-4s | Festival ambiance |

**VOICE TRIGGERING RULES**:
- Never play same voice snippet twice within 5 minutes
- Agent voice tone selected based on Relationship Score: high relationship = friendly pool, low relationship = curt/aggressive pool
- Director voice tone selected based on Morale and Momentum: high = satisfied/excited, low = frustrated
- Volume varies with emotional intensity: aggressive is louder (+3 dB), concern is quieter (-3 dB)

## 6. Mix Hierarchy & Frequency Management

### 6.1 The Cocktail Party Problem

BACKLOT has dense soundscapes — offices with phones and typing, sets with crew and equipment, theaters with 400 people. The player must be able to extract signal from noise. The mix hierarchy is not just about loudness — it is about frequency separation, spatial positioning, and temporal gating.

**FREQUENCY ALLOCATION BY SOUND CATEGORY**:

| Category | Primary Frequency Range | Purpose | Mix Strategy |
|----------|------------------------|---------|--------------|
| **Bass Foundation** | 40-120 Hz | Room tones, HVAC, distant rumble, emotional weight | Very quiet (-40 dB), felt more than heard. Adds warmth and space |
| **Low-Mid Presence** | 120-400 Hz | Footsteps, door closes, furniture, male voices (fundamental), body | Character and physicality. Avoid mud by using side-chain compression on overlapping elements |
| **Mid Intelligibility** | 400-2500 Hz | Voices (intelligibility range), phone rings, alerts, paper, most SFX | THE CRITICAL RANGE. This is where information lives. Maximum clarity required |
| **High-Mid Detail** | 2500-6000 Hz | Paper rustle, keyboard taps, crispness, clarity, "air" on voices | Detail and presence. Adds definition without harshness |
| **High Texture** | 6000-12000 Hz | Ambiance air, tape hiss (analog nostalgia), breath, fabric, shimmer | Texture and realism. Very quiet (-36 dB), subliminal |
| **Ultra-High Air** | 12000-20000 Hz | Room air, digital silence (paradoxically has high-frequency content), extreme detail | Barely audible, adds "liveness" to recordings |

**FREQUENCY MASKING MITIGATION**:
- When dialogue/voice plays (400-2500 Hz dominant), side-chain compress ambiance in that range by -6 dB
- When bass-heavy sound plays (door slam, heavy footsteps), briefly duck bass foundation layer to prevent mud
- Keyboard and paper sounds (high-mid heavy) are EQ'd to avoid overlapping with voice intelligibility range — slight high-shelf boost (+2 dB at 4kHz) for clarity, gentle cut at 800-1200 Hz to make room for voices

### 6.2 Dynamic Range Strategy

BACKLOT targets moderate dynamic range for accessibility and emotional impact:

**LOUDNESS TARGETS** (LUFS):
- **Overall Program**: -18 LUFS (comfortable, not fatiguing, matches modern game standards)
- **Ambiance Beds**: -32 to -28 LUFS (quiet foundation)
- **Player Action SFX**: -22 to -18 LUFS (immediate, clear)
- **Critical Alerts**: -20 LUFS (cut through without startling)
- **Music**: -24 to -20 LUFS (present but not dominant, except emotional peaks)
- **Peak Moments (Standing Ovation, Bankruptcy Theme)**: -16 LUFS (allowed to be louder, rare)

**DYNAMIC RANGE COMPRESSION**:
- Light program-level compression (2:1 ratio, threshold -24 dB) to maintain loudness consistency without squashing transients
- Heavy compression on ambiance beds (4:1 ratio, threshold -30 dB) to keep them controlled and non-intrusive
- NO compression on player action SFX (preserve transient punch for tactile feedback)
- Gentle limiting (-0.5 dB ceiling) to prevent clipping on peak moments

### 6.3 Mix Bus Structure

**SIGNAL FLOW**:

```
Individual SFX/Music → Category Submix → Phase Master → Final Master
```

**CATEGORY SUBMIXES** (each with EQ and compression):

| Submix | Contents | Processing | Send Level to Master |
|--------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Player Actions** | Clicks, drags, stamps, writes | EQ: +2 dB high-shelf at 4kHz (clarity), -3 dB at 300 Hz (reduce body). No compression | -2 dB |
| **Voices** | All voice snippets, filtered and unfiltered | EQ: Bandpass or natural depending on source. Compression: 3:1, -18 dB threshold (intelligibility) | -4 dB |
| **Alerts** | Crisis alerts, phone rings, urgent sounds | EQ: +4 dB presence boost at 2kHz (attention-grabbing). Light compression 2:1 | 0 dB (loudest submix) |
| **Ambiance** | All ambient beds, room tones, distant sounds | EQ: Low-cut at 40 Hz (remove rumble), gentle high-shelf -2 dB at 10kHz (reduce harshness). Heavy compression 4:1 | -8 dB |
| **Music** | All music tracks | EQ: Gentle, depends on track. Compression: 2.5:1, -20 dB threshold (evenness) | -6 dB (varies per track) |
| **Detail SFX** | Paper, footsteps, equipment, secondary sounds | EQ: High-pass at 80 Hz (clarity), +1 dB at 5kHz (detail). Light compression 2:1 | -6 dB |
| **Reactions** | Crew reactions, audience reactions, talent responses | EQ: Natural, slight presence boost. Compression: 3:1 (keep energy consistent) | -4 dB |

**PHASE MASTERS** (each game phase has a master bus for phase-specific global processing):

| Phase | Global Processing | Purpose |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| **Office Phases (Greenlight, Ledger, Talent Web)** | Subtle analog warmth (tape saturation plugin, very light), gentle high-cut at 14kHz (cozy, indoor) | Make the office feel lived-in, warm, slightly analog |
| **Production Phase** | No global color, wide stereo image, slight room reverb send (2.2s RT60) | Keep it open, energetic, real-time feeling |
| **Post-Production Phase** | Slight digital clarity (very subtle exciter), focused stereo image (narrower than production) | Precision, focus, cerebral |
| **Festival Phase** | Large hall reverb send (2.8s RT60, 15% wet), full stereo width, emotional space | Immersive, public, high-stakes |

**FINAL MASTER**:
- Final limiter: -0.3 dB ceiling (safety against clipping)
- Very gentle mastering EQ: +0.5 dB shelf at 10kHz (air), -1 dB broad cut at 250 Hz (reduce mud)
- Stereo width: Natural (no artificial widening, maintain phase coherence)

### 6.4 Accessibility Mixing Options

BACKLOT provides player-adjustable mix profiles for accessibility:

| Profile | What It Does | Implementation |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Dialogue Boost** | Increases voice and alert channel by +6 dB, reduces ambiance by -4 dB | Submix level adjustments |
| **Reduce Background** | Ambiance and detail SFX reduced by -8 dB, only critical sounds and player actions remain prominent | Helps with auditory processing issues |
| **Mono Mix** | Collapses stereo to mono, removes panning | For hearing impairment in one ear |
| **Visual Alerts** | Adds visual indicators for critical audio cues (phone ring = phone icon flashes, crisis alert = red border pulse) | Not audio change, but compensates for audio reliance |
| **Subtitles for Tone** | When voice snippets play, text appears: "[Agent, firm tone]", "[Director, frustrated]" | Communicates emotional content without requiring hearing |

---

## 7. Implementation Plan & Technical Requirements

### 7.1 Audio Middleware Selection

**Recommendation: FMOD Studio**

**Rationale**:
- Mature, well-documented, widely adopted in indie development
- Excellent adaptive music support (layers, transitions, parameters)
- Event-based system allows designers (not just programmers) to iterate on audio implementation
- Unity and Unreal integration is seamless
- Mobile-friendly (if Switch/iPad ports happen)
- Cost: Free for indie projects under certain revenue thresholds, then tiered licensing

**Alternative: Wwise**
- More powerful for extremely complex adaptive systems
- Steeper learning curve, better for AAA-scale projects
- BACKLOT's audio complexity is well within FMOD's capabilities, Wwise would be over-engineering

**Fallback: Unity Native Audio**
- If budget is extremely tight, Unity's built-in audio can handle BACKLOT
- Requires more programmer time (less designer iteration)
- Adaptive music is more manual (scripted crossfades vs. FMOD's parameter-driven system)
- Acceptable for MVP, upgrade to FMOD for polish

### 7.2 Audio Asset Specifications

**FILE FORMATS**:
- **SFX**: WAV, 48kHz, 24-bit (source files), converted to OGG Vorbis for build (compression saves space, quality loss is negligible)
- **Music**: WAV, 48kHz, 24-bit (source), converted to OGG Vorbis (music benefits most from compression, file sizes are large)
- **Ambiance Beds**: WAV, 48kHz, 24-bit (source), stereo, loopable (clean loop points), converted to OGG
- **Voice**: WAV, 48kHz, 24-bit (source), mono or stereo depending on recording setup, converted to OGG

**COMPRESSION SETTINGS**:
- OGG Vorbis quality level: 7 (good balance of quality and size, ~192 kbps equivalent)
- For very short SFX (<1s), consider keeping as WAV (decompression overhead is not worth the space savings)
- Music: OGG quality 8 or 9 (higher quality, music is more sensitive to compression artifacts)

**NAMING CONVENTION**:
```
[category]_[name]_[variation]_[metadata].wav

Examples:
sfx_script_slide_01_wood.wav
sfx_phone_ring_agent_02_insistent.wav
amb_office_afternoon_stereo_loop.wav
mus_theme_greenlight_fullmix.wav
vo_agent_friendly_03.wav
```

**ASSET COUNTS (Estimated)**:

| Asset Type | Quantity | Avg Duration | Storage (uncompressed) | Storage (OGG) |
|------------|----------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| UI/Player Action SFX | 120 files | 0.5s | 60 MB | 12 MB |
| Production SFX | 200 files | 1.5s | 300 MB | 45 MB |
| Ambiance Beds | 30 files | 120s (looping) | 3600 MB | 400 MB |
| Voice Snippets | 100 files | 5s | 500 MB | 75 MB |
| Music Tracks | 12 files | 120s avg | 1440 MB | 180 MB |
| Procedural Element Pools | 150 files | 1s avg | 150 MB | 25 MB |
| **TOTAL** | ~612 files | — | **6050 MB** | **737 MB** |

**Final build audio size: ~750 MB** (acceptable for PC/Switch, may need further optimization for mobile)

### 7.3 Interactive Audio Parameters (FMOD)

**3D vs 2D STRATEGY**:
- **2D (non-spatial)**: UI, player actions, music, alerts, most ambiance (ambiance is "environmental" but not positioned)
- **3D (spatial)**: Voices on set (director calls, crew chatter), equipment sounds during production (positioned in stereo field), footsteps (distance-based), specific diegetic sources (radio playing in corner of office)
- BACKLOT uses "2.5D" — most sounds are 2D (stereo positioned) rather than true 3D (since camera is fixed/isometric)

### 7.5 Production Pipeline

**PHASE 1: PRE-PRODUCTION (4-6 weeks)**
1. **Sound Design Document Approval** (this document)
2. **Asset List Generation**: Expand section 3's SFX lists into full asset breakdown (exact file names, durations, recording notes)

| Line Item | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Sound Designer Salary** | $60,000 | 9 months, mid-level indie rate (~$80K annual equivalent) |
| **Composer Fee** | $12,000 | 12 tracks, $1000/track (indie rate, includes stems) |
| **Voice Actors** | $3,600 | 6 actors × $300/day × 2 days (non-union, indie rate) |
| **Voice Director** | $800 | 2 days × $400/day (if external) |
| **Field Recording Equipment Rental** | $2,000 | Mics, recorders, accessories for 2-week period |
| **Studio Rental (Foley)** | $4,000 | 8 days × $500/day (mid-tier Foley stage) |
| **Studio Rental (Voice)** | $1,200 | 2 days × $600/day (voice recording booth) |
| **Sound Library Licensing** | $2,500 | Premium libraries for augmentation |
| **FMOD License** | $0 - $2,000 | Free if indie revenue < threshold, otherwise tiered |
| **Mix Engineer** | $3,000 | 1 week, final polish |
| **Misc (hard drives, cables, travel)** | $1,500 | Buffer for unexpected costs |
| **TOTAL** | **$92,600** | Full indie audio production budget |

**BUDGET SCALING OPTIONS**:

**LEAN BUDGET (~$50K)**:
- Sound Designer is also Composer (removes $12K fee, increases SD time investment)
- Reduce voice actor count to 4 ($2,400 instead of $3,600)
- Skip external Field Recording Engineer, SD handles it ($0 instead of equipment rental overhead)
- Use more sound library content, less custom recording ($5K library budget, reduce studio rental)
- Skip external Mix Engineer, SD handles final mix
- Total: ~$48,000

**PREMIUM BUDGET (~$150K)**:
- Hire senior Sound Designer and separate Implementation Engineer
- Hire known indie composer with festival film credits ($25K+ for music)
- Union voice actors, professional voice director
- More extensive field recording (travel to actual festivals for authentic ambiance)
- Professional Foley artist and Foley editor (dedicated roles)
- Mastering engineer for final polish
- Total: ~$145,000

**BACKLOT should target the mid-range budget ($90-100K)** for production-quality audio that matches the game's ambition.

### 7.7 Technical Requirements & Platform Considerations

**PLATFORM TARGETS**:

| Platform | Audio Format | Max File Size | Special Considerations |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **PC (Steam)** | OGG Vorbis | No practical limit | Primary platform, full audio fidelity |
| **Nintendo Switch** | OGG Vorbis or ADPCM | 1 GB audio budget (conservative) | May need lower OGG quality (level 6 instead of 7), optimize ambiance bed sizes |
| **iPad/Mobile (stretch)** | AAC or OGG | 500 MB audio budget | Significant optimization required: shorter ambiance loops, fewer variations, lower sample rate (44.1kHz) |

**MEMORY BUDGET**:
- **Streaming Audio** (ambiance beds, music): Loaded from disk, not in RAM. Switch: max 2 simultaneous stereo streams (safe). PC: no practical limit
- **Loaded Audio** (SFX, voices): Held in RAM. Switch: 150 MB budget for loaded audio. PC: 300 MB budget
- **Strategy**: Long sounds (>10s) stream, short sounds (<10s) load into RAM

**PERFORMANCE TARGETS**:
- **Max Simultaneous Voices**: 32 (Switch), 64 (PC). FMOD handles voice stealing (lowest priority sounds cut when limit reached)
- **CPU Budget**: <5% of frame time on audio processing (FMOD is efficient, this is conservative)
- **Disk I/O**: Streaming audio should not cause frame hitches. Pre-load ambiance beds 2-3 seconds before phase transitions

## 8. Silence Map — Where and Why

Silence is not absence. Silence is composition. BACKLOT uses silence structurally to create anticipation, mark consequence, and let decisions land.

### 8.1 Silence Moments (Comprehensive List)

| Moment | Duration | Ambiance Level | Purpose | Emotional Effect |
|--------|----------|----------------|---------|------------------|
| **Greenlight stamp (after)** | 2s | -45 dB | Let the commitment land | Weight of decision |
| **Casting final signature (before)** | 1.5s | -38 dB | Pause before binding agreement | Gravity of contract |
| **Production: Director calls "Action" (before)** | 1.5s | -40 dB | Anticipation before creation begins | Held breath, creation about to happen |
| **Production: Breakthrough take (after "Cut")** | 4s | -45 dB, then reactions | Reverence for great work captured | Awe, recognition of excellence |
| **Production: Catastrophic crisis (immediate reaction)** | 2s | -50 dB | Shock before scrambling | Oh fuck |
| **Dailies: Rough cut ends** | 4-6s | -60 dB (near-mute) | Player sits with their film | Did we make something good? |
| **Festival: Theater lights fully down, before projector** | 2-3s | -55 dB | 400 people holding breath | Collective anticipation |
| **Festival: Film ends, before audience reaction** | 1.5-3s | -60 dB | Judgment arriving | The moment of truth |
| **Festival: Award envelope opened, before name read** | 1.5s | -50 dB | Anticipation of validation or loss | Hope/fear collision |
| **Bankruptcy notice (before music)** | 3s | -55 dB | Realization before grief | The end arriving |
| **Year-end review: Before new year begins** | 2s | -45 dB | Reflection before reset | What have I built? |
| **Studio closure (final moment)** | 5s | -60 dB, fadeout | The end | Finality |

### 8.2 Implementation of Silence

Silence is not achieved by muting all audio. It is achieved by:
1. **Ducking ambiance** to near-imperceptible levels (-45 to -60 dB)
2. **Stopping detail layers** (no paper, no footsteps, no distant activity)
3. **Preserving room tone** (very quiet, -50 dB, so silence feels like silence in a space, not digital void)
4. **Reverb tails** are allowed to decay naturally (don't cut them, let them fade)
5. **Player breath** (very subtle, in some silence moments, the player character's own breathing is the only sound at -40 dB)

**BREATHING IN SILENCE**:
In moments of extreme silence (rough cut screening end, film premiere before reaction), a very quiet breathing sound (-40 to -38 dB) is added:
- **High-stakes silence** (festival): Controlled breathing, slightly elevated heart rate (subtle)
- **Reflective silence** (rough cut): Slower, deeper breathing, contemplative
- **Shocked silence** (catastrophic crisis): Sharp inhale, held breath, slow exhale

This grounds the player in their body. Silence is not absence — it is the sound of the player, alone with consequence.

### 8.3 Silence Duration Calibration

Silence durations are calibrated based on playtest feedback:
- **Too short (<1s)**: Player does not register the silence, moment is lost
- **Too long (>6s in most cases)**: Player becomes uncomfortable, thinks the game has frozen
- **Sweet spot**: 2-4s for most reflective silences, up to 6s for the single most important silence (rough cut screening end)

**EXCEPTION**: The rough cut screening silence can extend to 6s because:
1. The player expects a reaction (they are waiting for applause or critique)
2. The visual (credits rolling) confirms the game is not frozen
3. The discomfort is intentional — the player should sit with uncertainty

## 9. Audio Accessibility & Player Options

### 9.1 Accessibility Features

BACKLOT is committed to audio accessibility. These features are non-negotiable for launch:

| Feature | What It Does | Implementation |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Dialogue/Alert Boost** | Increases voice and critical alert volume by +6 dB, reduces ambiance by -4 dB | FMOD submix level adjustments via game setting |
| **Reduce Background Noise** | Ambiance and detail SFX reduced by -8 dB, only essential sounds remain prominent | Submix ducking |
| **Mono Audio** | Collapses stereo to mono, removes all panning | FMOD master bus setting |
| **Visual Alert Indicators** | Critical audio events (phone ring, crisis alert) also trigger visual UI indicators | Code implementation, icon flash or border pulse |
| **Subtitle for Emotional Tone** | Voice snippets display text: "[Agent, firm tone]", "[Director, frustrated]", etc. | Subtitle system, not full dialogue but emotional context |
| **Separate Volume Sliders** | Music, SFX, Ambiance, Voice — independent volume control | Standard game audio options |
| **Mute Toggle** | Player can mute all audio (game remains playable with visual indicators) | Accessibility requirement |

### 9.2 Player Audio Settings (In-Game Menu)

**AUDIO OPTIONS MENU**:

```
AUDIO SETTINGS

Master Volume:        [========|---] 80%
Music Volume:         [=====|------] 50%
SFX Volume:           [=======|----] 70%
Ambiance Volume:      [====|-------] 40%
Voice Volume:         [======|-----] 60%

[ ] Dialogue Boost (increases voice clarity)
[ ] Reduce Background Noise
[ ] Mono Audio
[ ] Visual Alert Indicators

ACCESSIBILITY
[ ] Emotional Tone Subtitles
[ ] Extended Silence Timings (adds +1s to all silence moments for processing time)
```

### 9.3 Hearing Impairment Considerations

For players with hearing impairments, BACKLOT must remain fully playable:

**VISUAL COMPENSATIONS**:
- Phone rings: Phone icon flashes in UI corner
- Crisis alerts: Red border pulse on screen, crisis text appears immediately
- Morale/Momentum shifts: Subtle UI color shifts (green = high morale, red = low morale)
- Audience reactions: Visual meter during festival screening shows reception in real-time (not just audio)
- Breakthrough moments: Visual "spark" effect or golden glow on scene card

**DESIGN PRINCIPLE**: Audio enhances, but never gates. Every piece of information communicated through audio must also be available visually.

## 10. Conclusion — Audio IS Game Feel

BACKLOT without sound is a functional simulation. BACKLOT with sound is a film studio that breathes.

The phone that rings at the wrong time. The slate clap before the breakthrough take. The silence before the lights go down. The applause that builds from nothing to everything. These sounds are not decoration. They are the game's nervous system. They tell the player what they need to know before their eyes do. They make the office feel inhabited, the set feel chaotic, the theater feel full of judgment.

Every sound in BACKLOT has a purpose:
- **Inform** (crisis alerts, morale shifts, financial warnings)
- **Immerse** (ambiance beds, spatial positioning, diegetic music)
- **Reward** (breakthrough chimes, applause, positive reactions)
- **Punish** (walkout footsteps, silence after failure, dissonant tones)
- **Ground** (room tones, breath, paper, the tactile reality of decisions)

This document is not a wish list. It is a production plan. Every sound described here can be recorded, implemented, and mixed within the budget and timeline outlined. The technical requirements are achievable. The adaptive systems are proven (FMOD handles this complexity routinely). The silence map is testable.

What cannot be tested until the game exists is whether the player leans forward when the lights go down. Whether they hold their breath when the envelope opens. Whether they feel the weight of the greenlight stamp. Whether they hear the cost of making something real.

If they do, we have succeeded.

If they do not, we go back to the mix.

**Close your eyes. What do you hear?**

A film studio. A bet. A standing ovation, or a walkout. The sound of someone who believed in something fragile, and put it into the world.

That is BACKLOT.

## APPENDIX C: Voice Recording Direction (Sample)

**VOICE ACTOR BRIEF — AGENT (PHONE) VOICES**

**Role**: Talent agent, representing actors/directors/writers. Heard only over phone (bandpass filtered 300-3kHz).

**Emotional Range Needed**: Friendly, Neutral, Curt, Aggressive

**Recording Setup**: SM7B, 6-inch distance, cardioid, dry (no reverb), 48kHz/24-bit

**Direction Notes**:
- NO intelligible words. We need emotional tone and cadence only
- Imagine you are negotiating a deal, but speak in gibberish or hum the sentence structure
- Each take should sound like a sentence: rising tone for question, falling tone for statement
- We will use these in context, so the player will infer meaning from tone

**TAKES NEEDED**:

1. **Friendly Agent** (4 takes, 4-6s each):
   - "Warm greeting, proposing a deal that benefits both parties"
   - "Laughing at a joke, then making a gentle ask"
   - "Expressing gratitude, relationship is good"
   - "Offering flexibility, acknowledging past collaboration"

2. **Neutral Agent** (4 takes, 4-6s each):
   - "Stating terms clearly, no warmth but no hostility"
   - "Asking a clarifying question, professional tone"
   - "Delivering a counter-offer, matter-of-fact"
   - "Confirming agreement, businesslike"

3. **Curt Agent** (4 takes, 4-6s each):
   - "Short, clipped sentences, impatient"
   - "Repeating terms, annoyed at having to explain"
   - "Rejecting an offer, dismissive"
   - "Ending conversation, no time for this"

4. **Aggressive Agent** (4 takes, 5-8s each):
   - "Making a demand, not a request, louder"
   - "Expressing frustration, client is worth more than this"
   - "Threatening to walk away, firm tone"
   - "Final offer, take it or leave it, aggressive closer"

**Total takes**: 16 per actor (we need 2 agents, 1M 1F, so 32 total agent takes)
