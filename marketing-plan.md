# BACKLOT — Marketing Plan

**Marketing Strategy by HYPE**
**Status: Launch-Ready Marketing Bible v1.0**
**Last Updated: 2026-02-07**

---

## THE HOOK

This is what sells BACKLOT in five seconds:

**Run a scrappy indie film studio in the mid-2000s. Greenlight the weird scripts. Wrangle ego-drunk actors. Survive chaotic shoots. Pray Sundance puts you on the map before your investors pull the plug.**

That is the scroll-stop line. That is the tweet. That is the Steam short description. Everything else is details.

What makes this hook work? Three things:

1. **Specificity kills vagueness.** Not "manage a studio." Not "make movies." Run a *scrappy indie film studio in the mid-2000s.* The specificity is the attraction. People who love this era will lean in immediately.

2. **The chaos is the selling point.** "Ego-drunk actors." "Chaotic shoots." "Pray Sundance puts you on the map." These are not bugs. They are features. The hook promises human drama, not spreadsheet optimization.

3. **The stakes are clear.** "Before your investors pull the plug." The player knows immediately: this is a survival game where art and commerce are at war, and you are the battlefield.

The GIF-worthy moment is this: a player reading a script coverage report for *The Apiarist* (a beekeeper discovers her hives produce psychoactive honey), casting a volatile method actor because he is the only one who can nail the role, watching dailies go sideways when he refuses direction, then cutting it together in post and submitting to Sundance. The camera pulls back from the darkened theater. The audience score ticks up in real time. Standing ovation. Palme d'Or nomination. The player exhales. That entire sequence — from messy creative decision to public judgment — is the hook. It is the feeling of putting something into the world and holding your breath.

Show the GAME, not the features. The marketing is not "manage talent relationships" and "track budgets." The marketing is "that actor you cast is sleeping in a van because he is method, your DP quit over a lens argument, your Sundance premiere got a twelve-minute standing ovation, and you still cannot make payroll." That is a story. That is the hook.

## TARGET AUDIENCE

### Primary Audience: The Management Sim Obsessives
**Demographics**: Ages 24-40, PC gamers, 65% male / 30% female / 5% non-binary, college-educated, disposable income for indie games ($15-$30 price point sweet spot).

**Psychographics**: They have played Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Tropico, and Football Manager. They love systems but crave personality. They are the people who play tycoon games and think "Why are the employees just numbers?" They want management sims with sharper creative teeth. They hang out on r/tycoon, r/BaseBuildingGames, r/indiegaming, and management sim Discord servers.

**What they already play**: Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Tropico 6, Planet Zoo, Stardew Valley (management layer), RimWorld, Oxygen Not Included.

**What they watch**: Noclip documentaries, Game Maker's Toolkit, indie game post-mortems, behind-the-scenes dev vlogs.

**What they value**: Deep systems, emergent storytelling, replayability, meaningful choices with consequences.

**How to reach them**: Steam wishlist campaigns, YouTuber coverage (SplatterCat, Wanderbots, Retromation), Reddit AMAs, participation in Steam Next Fest, appearing in "best tycoon games" listicles.

**Why BACKLOT hooks them**: It is Game Dev Tycoon but with personalities instead of stat bars. Every talent has a name, a face, a wound, and an agent. The Talent Web is the feature they did not know they were missing.

### Secondary Audience: Film Enthusiasts Who Game Casually
**Demographics**: Ages 20-35, cross-platform (PC + Switch preferred), 50/50 gender split, film school grads, aspiring filmmakers, Criterion Channel subscribers.

**Psychographics**: They watch Every Frame a Painting on YouTube. They own the Criterion Channel. They have a Letterboxd account with 500+ ratings and strong opinions about A24. They play narrative games (Disco Elysium, Pentiment, Return of the Obra Dinn), walking sims, and the occasional management sim. The film industry subject matter is the on-ramp. They hang out on Film Twitter, r/TrueFilm, r/Filmmakers, and Letterboxd.

**What they already play**: Disco Elysium, Pentiment, Papers Please, Her Story, Unpacking, A Mortician's Tale, What Remains of Edith Finch.

**What they watch**: Video essays (Every Frame a Painting, Patrick Willems, Lindsay Ellis), Criterion Channel, MUBI, director retrospectives, film festival coverage.

**What they value**: Authenticity, narrative depth, thematic resonance, period accuracy, creative process representation.

**How to reach them**: Film Twitter (not called X in 2005, so we honor that), Letterboxd integrations, partnerships with film YouTubers, festival circuit presence (PAX, IndieCade as the game festivals; Sundance/Tribeca as cultural moment marketing), press coverage in film-adjacent outlets (IndieWire, The Film Stage, Filmmaker Magazine).

**Why BACKLOT hooks them**: It respects filmmaking. It is not a parody. It is not Hollywood fantasy. It is the mid-2000s indie film scene rendered with specificity and love. They will recognize the Miramax collapse, the DVD revenue crisis, the digital camera debates. The game is a mirror for their cinephilia.

### Tertiary Audience: Creative Industry Professionals
**Demographics**: Ages 25-45, any platform, 40% male / 50% female / 10% non-binary, working professionals in creative fields (design, writing, music, game dev, theater).

**Psychographics**: They see themselves in the art-vs-commerce tension. Designers, writers, musicians, game developers — anyone who has had to choose between the project that pays and the project that matters. The game is a mirror for their professional lives, wrapped in a film industry skin. They hang out on creative industry subreddits (r/gamedev, r/writing, r/WeAreTheMusicMakers), Twitter/X professional networks, LinkedIn (for the older cohort).

**What they already play**: Less predictable. Some play management sims, some play narrative games, some do not game much but will play something that resonates with their creative struggle.

**What they value**: Emotional honesty, thematic depth, systems that reflect real creative constraints.

**How to reach them**: Creative industry press (Creative Bloq, It's Nice That, Fast Company Design), podcasts about creative process, GDC talks (if we can get a postmortem slot), word-of-mouth from influencers in their fields.

**Why BACKLOT hooks them**: The Ledger is their freelance income spreadsheet. The Greenlight Table is every pitch they have made. The Production Clock is every deadline they have missed. The game tells their story in a different industry's language, and that translation makes the universal visible.

## UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION

There are studio management sims. There are movie-making tycoon games. There is not a single game that simulates the human reality of independent filmmaking — the egos, the compromises, the 3 AM arguments about whether the ending works, the distributor who loves the film but wants you to change the title.

**BACKLOT is the first management sim where your resources argue back.**

It is the first tycoon game where the tension is not efficiency versus waste. The tension is art versus commerce, belief versus survival, the movie you want to make versus the movie you can afford to make.

The comparable games abstract people into stat bars. BACKLOT makes people the entire game. You are not assigning a nameless team to a genre/topic combo (Game Dev Tycoon). You are negotiating with a volatile actor's representation while your writer threatens to take her script to Focus Features if you cast "that guy from the insurance commercial." The units you manage are artists with taste, pride, and breaking points.

Nobody else is making this game because nobody else is treating creative management as a human drama rather than an optimization puzzle.

The marketing one-liner is: **"Game Dev Tycoon meets The Player. Manage artists, not assets."**

The Steam tags that define us: **Management, Simulation, Indie, Drama, Choices Matter, Singleplayer, Story Rich, Replay Value, 2000s**

3. Festival presence (additional indie game festivals: IndieCade, BIG Festival, Develop:Brighton)

---

## STORE PAGE COPY

The Steam store page is the single most important marketing asset. Here is the copy, structured for maximum conversion.

### Short Description (first 200 characters, appears in search and capsules):

*Run a scrappy indie film studio in the mid-2005s. Greenlight scripts, wrangle ego-drunk actors, survive chaotic shoots, and pray Sundance puts you on the map before your investors pull the plug.*

---

### About This Game (long description):

**You are the person who decides which films get made.**

Not Hollywood blockbusters. The weird, beautiful, probably-doomed ones. The non-linear drama about a deaf saxophonist in Reno. The beekeeper whose hives produce psychoactive honey. The mumblecore relationship study shot on a DV camera in someone's apartment. The ones that either win Cannes or go straight to a Blockbuster bargain bin.

**BACKLOT is a film studio management sim set in the mid-2000s indie film scene** — the moment between Miramax's collapse and A24's birth, when DVD revenue was dying but nobody would admit it, when digital cameras were crossing the quality threshold, and when a good Sundance premiere could change your life.

**MANAGE ARTISTS, NOT ASSETS**

Your talent has names, faces, egos, and agents. Actors have range profiles, salary demands, and personal lives that generate events. Directors have vision scores and feuds with DPs. Writers pitch scripts and threaten to take them elsewhere if you cast "that guy from the insurance commercial."

The Talent Web tracks every relationship. Who worked together. Who hates whom. Who owes favors. Casting is not just about finding the best actor. It is about finding the actor who will show up, stay sober, take direction, and not alienate your cinematographer.

**GREENLIGHT THE SCRIPTS THAT MATTER**

Every week, scripts arrive. Cold submissions, agent pitches, your own development slate. Each one has procedurally generated attributes: genre, tone, structural ambition, thematic depth, commercial viability, and a "pretension index" that measures the gap between what the script thinks it is and what it actually is.

You read coverage reports written like real coverage. You make the call. The Greenlight Table is where your values become action.

**SURVIVE THE SHOOT**

Production is the pressure cooker. Your lead actor and director stop speaking after a take dispute. Rain hits your exterior day. The DP quits over a lens disagreement. A teamster dispute shuts down base camp.

Every crisis is a choice between competing goods: quality versus schedule, morale versus budget, the director's vision versus the producer's pragmatism. The Production Clock tracks it all, day by day, until you wrap or implode.

**CUT IT TOGETHER IN POST**

The footage you shot is a collection of scene cards with quality ratings: performance, cinematography, pacing, emotional impact, coherence. Your editor assembles them into a cut. You choose an editorial approach: tight and propulsive, slow and meditative, nonlinear, montage-heavy, naturalistic.

This is where troubled productions get saved and smooth shoots get ruined. The Avid Bay is your last line of defense.

**PREMIERE AT SUNDANCE (OR CANNES, OR TORONTO, OR SKIP FESTIVALS ENTIRELY)**

Completed films enter the festival circuit. You choose a strategy. Each festival has simulated juries with taste profiles that shift year to year. Your film's attributes are scored against jury preferences, press appetite, and competition.

A Palme d'Or nomination changes your trajectory. A walkout screening haunts you for three projects.

**SURVIVE ON A SHOESTRING (OR DON'T)**

The Ledger is the oxygen system. Every production burns cash. Revenue comes from distribution deals (theatrical, VOD, DVD, international sales — this is the mid-2000s, physical media still matters), festival prize money, and investor interest.

You can chase grants, but grants want artistic ambition. You can take investors, but investors want commercial projects. The tension between these funding sources is the economic expression of the art-vs-commerce theme.

Bankruptcy is the hard fail state. But there is a softer failure — creative irrelevance, when your reputation drops so low that no good talent will work with you. This is worse than bankruptcy because the game does not end. It just stops being fun.

**WHAT KIND OF STUDIO ARE YOU BUILDING?**

Every film you greenlight, every actor you cast, every compromise you make or refuse — these decisions accumulate into an identity. Some players build commercial engines. Others build shelves of festival trophies and mounting debt.

The game does not judge. It simply asks: who is this studio when no one is watching? Who are you, when the credits roll?

**FEATURES**

- **The Greenlight Table**: Read coverage reports, evaluate scripts, commit to projects. What you choose to make defines everything downstream.
- **The Talent Web**: 80-120 simulated actors, directors, writers, and crew with stats, personalities, relationships, and egos. Manage a creative ecosystem, not a spreadsheet.
- **The Production Clock**: Day-by-day shoot simulation with crisis events, creative decisions, and consequences. Front-load difficult scenes. Manage morale. Survive.
- **The Avid Bay**: Post-production system where you shape raw footage into a finished film. Editorial approach, score, color grade, final cut decisions.
- **The Festival Circuit**: Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, Venice, Berlin. Each festival has distinct personality, jury tastes, and industry dynamics. Premiere strategically.
- **The Ledger**: Financial tracking, distribution deals, revenue projections, and the constant question: can I afford the film I believe in?
- **Emergent Storytelling**: Every studio playthrough is different. Your relationships with talent evolve. Your reputation shapes opportunities. The industry remembers.

**FOR FANS OF:**
- Game Dev Tycoon (creative industry simulation)
- Disco Elysium (personality-driven mechanics)
- Pentiment (period authenticity and material culture)
- Papers, Please (meaningful decisions under pressure)
- The Player (Robert Altman, 1992)
- Living in Oblivion (the chaos of low-budget filmmaking)

## SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY

### Platform Breakdown

**Twitter/X** (Primary Platform)
- **Audience**: Management sim players, film enthusiasts, game devs, press
- **Content**: Daily posts. Mix of devlog threads, GIFs, procedural script coverage drops, "This Week in Indie Film History," replies to fans, live-tweeting the dev process
- **Tone**: Enthusiastic, knowledgeable, self-aware. HYPE's voice. Not corporate. Not desperate. Confident and warm.
- **Posting Cadence**: 1-2 posts/day during pre-launch, 3-4 posts/day during launch week, 5-7 posts/day during major events (Next Fest, launch)
- **Hashtags**: #BACKLOT, #indiegame, #indiedev, #gamedev, #filmsim, #managementsim, #screenshotsaturday (when applicable), #wishlisting (ironic but effective)

**TikTok** (Growth Platform)
- **Audience**: Younger gamers (18-30), film students, creative industry workers
- **Content**: 15-60 second clips. Focus on "oddly satisfying" moments (script drag, budget number roll, headshot pinning). "POV: You are an indie film producer" skits. "This script coverage report is either genius or pretentious, you decide" engagement bait.
- **Tone**: Fast, punchy, self-aware, meme-adjacent but not cringe
- **Posting Cadence**: 3-4 posts/week during pre-launch, daily during launch week
- **Hashtags**: #indiegame, #gametok, #filmmajor, #filmmaker, #indiefilm, #gamedev, #cozy games (stretch but the vibe fits)

**Instagram** (Visual Showcase)
- **Audience**: Overlap with TikTok but slightly older (25-40)
- **Content**: Screenshot drops (the office in different states, character profiles with headshot art, coverage reports as carousel posts), behind-the-scenes art process, dev team candids
- **Tone**: Polished, warm, aspirational
- **Posting Cadence**: 3-4 posts/week
- **Stories**: Daily during active campaign periods (behind-the-scenes, polls, Q&A stickers)

**YouTube** (Long-Form Archive)
- **Audience**: Players researching the game, press looking for b-roll
- **Content**: Devlog videos (5-10 min each), trailers, gameplay deep-dives, post-launch dev diaries
- **Tone**: Informative, thoughtful, inviting
- **Posting Cadence**: 1 video every 2 weeks during pre-launch, 1/week during launch month

**Discord** (Community Hub)
- **Audience**: Dedicated fans, beta testers, modders (if modding becomes a thing), press
- **Content**: Exclusive dev updates, early screenshot drops, Q&A sessions, community events, bug reporting during beta/launch
- **Tone**: Friendly, collaborative, responsive
- **Moderation**: Active. Zero tolerance for bigotry, harassment, or spoilers without tags.

**Reddit** (Targeted Outreach, Not a Home Base)
- **Audience**: Each subreddit is distinct. Do not treat Reddit as monolithic.
- **Content**: Tailored posts for each subreddit. r/tycoon gets a systems-focused post. r/TrueFilm gets a thematic/period accuracy post. r/indiegaming gets a "we made this" post with humility and specifics.
- **Tone**: Humble, transparent, not salesy. Reddit smells marketing from a mile away. Be a developer talking to players, not a brand talking to consumers.
- **Posting Cadence**: 1-2 posts/month max. Do not spam. Engage in comments more than you post.

---

### Content Pillars

Every social post falls into one of five categories. This structure ensures variety and prevents content fatigue.

**Pillar 1: The Game (Gameplay and Systems)**
- GIFs of UI interactions
- "How the Talent Web works" explainer threads
- Procedurally generated script coverage examples
- Festival premiere sequences
- Budget management tips from the devs

**Pillar 2: The World (Setting and Authenticity)**

- Period-accurate technology spotlights (CRT monitors, film canisters, festival programs)
- Character profiles (Marlowe Finch, Dex Amari, June Okoro lore drops)
- Office evolution screenshots (scrappy startup > prestige powerhouse)

**Pillar 3: The Process (Behind-the-Scenes Dev)**
- Art direction breakdowns (how we chose the color palette, why Courier is the screenplay font)
- Design deep-dives (how we balance the art-vs-commerce economy)

> In most tycoon games, employees are stat bars. In BACKLOT, every actor, writer, and director is a fully simulated personality. They have egos. They have agents.

---

## METRICS AND SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Wishlist Targets (Primary KPI)
- **Month -9 (Announcement)**: 1,000 wishlists
- **Month -6 (Post-Devlog Momentum)**: 5,000 wishlists
- **Month -4 (Post-Demo)**: 10,000 wishlists
- **Launch Day**: 25,000 wishlists

**Conversion Rate Assumption**: 20-25% of wishlists convert to Week 1 purchases (industry average for indie games).
- 25,000 wishlists × 22.5% = ~5,600 Week 1 sales.

---

### Secondary KPIs
- **Social Media Followers** (combined across platforms): 5,000 by launch
- **Discord Members**: 5,000 by launch
- **Press Coverage**: 50+ articles/videos published by end of Month 1 post-launch
- **Steam Reviews**: 1,000+ reviews in first 6 months, 85%+ positive rating
- **YouTube Coverage**: 50+ videos published, 2M+ total views across all creators

---

### Post-Launch Sales Targets
- **Week 1**: 5,000 units
- **Month 1**: 10,000 units
- **Month 6**: 20,000 units
- **Year 1**: 50,000 units (stretch goal)

**Revenue Projections** (at $19.99 price point, assuming 30% platform cut):
- Week 1: 5,000 × $19.99 × 0.70 = $69,965
- Month 1: 10,000 × $19.99 × 0.70 = $139,930
- Month 6: 20,000 × $19.99 × 0.70 = $279,860
- Year 1: 50,000 × $19.99 × 0.70 = $699,650

---

## RISKS AND MITIGATION

### Risk 1: The Hook Doesn't Land
**Scenario**: Announcement trailer drops. Reddit comments say "so it's just Game Dev Tycoon with a film skin?"

**Mitigation**:
- The trailer and all marketing must emphasize personality over systems. Show Dex's headshot. Show the crisis event text. Show the Talent Web strings. Do not lead with "manage budgets and schedules." Lead with "wrangle ego-drunk actors."
- If early feedback suggests the hook is unclear, pivot messaging immediately. A/B test different taglines on paid social ads. Find the language that resonates.

### Risk 2: The Mid-2000s Setting Is Too Niche
**Scenario**: Younger players (Gen Z) do not connect with the 2005 indie film scene because they did not live it.

**Mitigation**:
- The setting is specific, but the themes are universal. Art vs. commerce. Survival. Creative compromise. These are not 2005 problems. They are eternal problems.
- Marketing should emphasize the human drama first, the period authenticity second. "You are a producer making impossible choices" is the lead. "Set in the mid-2000s indie film scene" is the flavor.
- If Gen Z engagement is low, shift TikTok content to focus on the mechanics and personalities, not the period nostalgia.

### Risk 3: Management Sim Fatigue
**Scenario**: The market is saturated with tycoon games. Players are tired of the genre.

**Mitigation**:
- BACKLOT is not "another tycoon game." It is a human drama that uses management sim structure. The Talent Web is the differentiator. Every marketing asset must hammer this home.
- Comparisons to Disco Elysium (personality-driven mechanics) and Papers, Please (meaningful decisions under pressure) position BACKLOT as genre-adjacent, not genre-typical.

### Risk 4: The Game Is Too Text-Heavy
**Scenario**: Players bounce off the coverage reports and dialogue. "I wanted to manage a studio, not read a novel."

**Mitigation**:
- Marketing must set expectations. This is a text-heavy game. The writing is the feature, not the bug. Players who love Disco Elysium and Pentiment are the target, not players who want Papers, Please's minimalism.
- Demo and trailer should show coverage reports in full. If a player sees that text and thinks "ugh, too much reading," they self-select out before purchase. Better a smaller, engaged audience than a large, disappointed one.

### Risk 5: Launch Week Bug Crisis
**Scenario**: Game launches. Day 1 patch does not fix a critical bug. Reviews are negative. Momentum dies.

**Mitigation**:
- This is outside marketing's control, but marketing's response is critical. Transparency and speed matter. If a launch bug happens:
  1. Acknowledge it publicly within 6 hours (Twitter/X, Steam community hub, Discord).
  2. Provide a timeline for the fix (hours, not days).
  3. Offer refunds with no friction if players are affected.
  4. Do not go silent. Communicate daily until resolved.
- The community will forgive bugs if the response is honest and fast. They will not forgive silence.

## FINAL NOTES FROM HYPE

This plan is aggressive but achievable. The budget is lean ($28K total). The timeline is tight (12 months). The targets are realistic but require discipline.

Here is what I need from the team:

**From the Devs**: Hit your milestones. I cannot market a game that is not ready. The demo must be polished by Month -5. The launch build must be stable by Month -1. If you slip, the entire timeline slips, and wishlist velocity collapses.

**From the Art Team**: Every screenshot must represent the visual identity. Do not send me half-finished UI. Do not send me placeholder art. The capsule image is the first thing 90% of players see. It must be perfect.

**From the Writers**: The coverage reports must sing. If the procedurally generated text feels algorithmic, the hook collapses. The writing is the marketing. Get it right.

**From the Community Manager** (if we have one): Respond to every Discord message. Reply to every Reddit comment. Thank every YouTube creator who covers the game. The community is small now. Make every person feel seen.

**To the Press and Influencers**: I will not waste your time. I will not send you a half-baked demo. I will not beg for coverage. I will send you a game I believe in, and if it is not your thing, I will respect that. But if it is your thing, I will support you however I can. Assets, interviews, access — just ask.

**To the Players**: You are not customers. You are collaborators. Your feedback shapes the game. Your stories make the marketing. Your wishlists make the launch possible. I will treat you with respect, honesty, and gratitude. Always.

This game exists because we believe in it. The marketing exists to find the people who will believe in it too. That is the job. Not to trick people into buying something they do not want. To connect the game with the audience that will love it.

Start building the audience NOW. Not six months from launch. Not three months from launch. Now.

The best marketing for an indie game is not a Super Bowl ad. It is not a million-dollar influencer deal. It is not a viral TikTok that gets 10M views.

The best marketing is this: a player sits at the Greenlight Table, reads the coverage report for *The Apiarist*, and thinks, "I need to make this film." Then they cast Dex, survive the shoot, cut it together, premiere at Cannes, and win. And they tell their friend. And their friend wishlists the game. And the cycle continues.

Word of mouth is the only marketing that lasts. Everything else — the trailers, the tweets, the press coverage — is kindling. The game is the fire.

Build a game worth talking about. I will make sure people hear about it.

Show the GAME, not the features.

What is the GIF?

Start building the audience NOW.
