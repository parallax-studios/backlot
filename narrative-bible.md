## 1. THE WORLD'S WOUND

### Defining Event: The Collapse of the Promise

In 1994, Quentin Tarantino walked onto the stage at Cannes with *Pulp Fiction* and the world believed, truly believed, that independent cinema was the future. Miramax became the dream factory. Sundance became the gateway. A generation of filmmakers quit their day jobs and maxed out their credit cards because the system had a door, and the door was open.

By 2005, the door is a wall with a door painted on it.

Miramax is a carcass. The Weinstein machine consumed the people it elevated. DVD revenue -- the invisible subsidy that kept every indie studio afloat -- is beginning its terminal decline, though the industry refuses to say the word "terminal" out loud. Digital cameras have democratized production, which means everyone can make a film, which means the festival submission piles are ten feet tall, which means your film has to scream louder to be heard, which means the thing that made indie film valuable -- its quietness, its intimacy, its refusal to scream -- is the very thing the market is selecting against.

This is the world's wound: **the promise that art could sustain itself was a lie, and everyone in this world either knows it and pretends otherwise, or doesn't know it and is about to find out.**

### Central Tension

**Art versus survival.** Not art versus commerce -- that framing is too clean, too philosophical. The actual tension is: *I believe this script is important, but if I make it, I cannot pay my editor next month.* The tension lives in the body, not the mind. It is the feeling of holding two truths simultaneously -- this work matters, and this work might destroy me -- and making a decision anyway.

Every character in the world navigates this tension differently. Some have surrendered to commerce and hate themselves for it. Some have martyred themselves for art and resent the world for not rewarding their sacrifice. The player sits at the center and makes the choice over and over, film after film, and the game never tells them which choice is right. Because there is no right choice. There is only the choice you can live with.

### The Big Lie

**"One more hit and I'll have the freedom to make whatever I want."**

This is the lie the industry tells itself. It is the lie every character believes in their own variation. The writer believes the next script will be the one that gets made without compromise. The actor believes the next role will be the one that proves they are serious. The producer believes the next deal will be the one that buys creative independence.

The truth is that freedom is not a destination. It is a negotiation that never ends. The game reveals this not through dialogue or cutscenes, but through the rhythm of play itself. The player achieves a hit. The money comes in. And immediately, the next set of constraints appears -- investors with expectations, talent with leverage, a reputation to protect or subvert. The treadmill does not stop. It changes speed.

### Texture: What Does This World Feel Like?

This world smells like cold coffee and photocopier toner. It sounds like a phone ringing in the next room and the muffled argument between a director and a producer through a closed door. It feels like holding a script that could be brilliant, turning it over in your hands, knowing that greenlighting it means canceling the safe project that would keep the lights on.

The light is always late afternoon. Warm, slanted, catching dust motes above a desk covered in headshots and coverage reports. The office hums with the low-grade anxiety of people who care too much about work that the world may never see. There is always a coffee mug that has gone cold. There is always a Post-it note with a number on it -- a budget figure, a screen count, a festival deadline -- that carries the weight of someone's dream.

Outside, the city is indifferent. Traffic. Pedestrians. The world does not care about your movie. That indifference is the world's texture: the vast, humming apathy against which every creative act is a small, defiant noise.

## 2. WORLD-BUILDING

### Geography: The Spaces That Shape the Story

**The Office (Your Studio Headquarters)**
The player's primary space. In the beginning, it is a converted loft in a neighborhood that was cheap five years ago and is being gentrified now. Exposed brick, mismatched furniture from three different decades, a poster for *Stranger Than Paradise* taped to the wall with painter's tape. The office evolves as the studio grows -- better furniture, framed one-sheets, a real conference room -- but the question embedded in every iteration is: *does this space feel like a place where good work happens, or a place where good work is administered?*

What does the player FEEL when they look at their office? Early on, they should feel scrappy possibility. Later, they should feel the creeping professionalization that is both necessary and dangerous. The office is a mirror.

**The Backlot**
Visible through the office window. A physical space where productions happen. Half-built sets, equipment trucks, crew in motion. The backlot is the game's visual heartbeat -- when production is active, it bustles. Between productions, it is empty, and that emptiness should feel like potential or like failure, depending on where the player is in their arc.

**The Festival Circuit**
Not a single location but a constellation of them, each with a distinct personality. Sundance is snow and altitude and the electric hum of American ambition -- Park City storefronts converted into screening venues, industry people in expensive casual wear pretending to be relaxed. Cannes is Mediterranean light and formal dress and the understanding that cinema is culture, not entertainment. Toronto is functional and dense and deal-oriented -- hotel lobbies as marketplaces. Berlin is political and cold and takes itself seriously in a way that is either admirable or exhausting. Each festival is a world unto itself, and the player should feel the shift when they enter one.

**The Screening Room**
A small, dark theater where the player watches their films debut. Not the film itself -- the player never sees the film -- but the audience. Silhouettes in seats. The sound of laughter, or silence, or a cough at the wrong moment. The screening room is where private work becomes public, and it is the most emotionally charged space in the game.

### History: What Happened Before the Player Arrives

**1989 -- The Sundance Reformation.** The Sundance Institute, under Robert Redford's stewardship, transforms from a workshop into the launchpad for American independent cinema. *sex, lies, and videotape* wins the Palme d'Or and grosses $36 million worldwide. The floodgates open.

**1993-1999 -- The Golden Age.** Miramax, Fine Line Features, October Films, and a dozen smaller distributors create an ecosystem where challenging films can reach audiences and make money. *Pulp Fiction*, *Fargo*, *The English Patient*, *Good Will Hunting*, *Shakespeare in Love*. The Oscars are contested territory. Independent film is not alternative -- it is ascendant.

**2000-2003 -- The Rot Sets In.** Miramax's methods become an open secret. Acquisitions become predatory. Marketing campaigns become Oscar-bait machines. The personal films that defined the movement are crowded out by prestige products engineered for awards. DVD revenue masks the underlying fragility -- everyone is spending like the money will last forever.

**2004 -- The Crack.** Disney and the Weinsteins divorce. Miramax as it was ceases to exist. The industry pretends this is a corporate restructuring. It is actually an earthquake. At the same time, digital cameras achieve a quality threshold that makes micro-budget filmmaking viable. The barrier to entry drops. The barrier to success does not.

**2005 -- Where the Game Begins.** The player opens their studio in this exact moment. The old model is broken. The new model does not exist yet. Every decision is a bet on which future arrives first: the one where indie film reinvents itself, or the one where it becomes irrelevant. The player does not know they are standing at a turning point. They just know the rent is due and a stack of scripts needs reading.

### Culture: Factions, Beliefs, and Conflicts

**The Auteur Faithful:** Directors, writers, and certain actors who believe that the singular vision of a creator is sacred. They will sacrifice commercial viability for artistic integrity without hesitation. They reference Kubrick, Tarkovsky, and Cassavetes. They view compromise as betrayal. Working with them produces the highest-ceiling films -- and the most volatile productions.

**The Industry Pragmatists:** Producers, distributors, sales agents, and financially-minded crew who believe that a film that is not seen is a film that does not exist. They know the numbers. They know that festival prestige does not pay the electric bill. They reference Soderbergh's ability to alternate between art and commerce as the ideal. Working with them produces reliable, fundable projects -- but risks the creative soul.

**The New Wave Upstarts:** A younger generation shooting on DV cameras, rejecting polish, embracing mumblecore's naturalism and micro-budgets. They view the establishment -- even the indie establishment -- as calcified. They are hungry, cheap, and occasionally brilliant. They are also untested, undisciplined, and may not show up on day two of the shoot.

**The Festival Gatekeepers:** Programmers, jury members, and press who collectively decide what "matters" in independent cinema each year. They are tastemakers with real power and capricious preferences. Their attention can make a career; their indifference can bury a film that deserved better.

These are not formal factions with membership cards. They are orientations, tendencies, gravitational pulls. Every character in the Talent Web exists somewhere in this constellation, and their position shifts as their career evolves.

### Rules: How the World Works

**Film is alchemy, not engineering.** You can assemble the best script, the best cast, the best crew, and the best budget, and the film can still fail. Conversely, a troubled production with a fractured cast and a hemorrhaging budget can produce something transcendent. Quality is probabilistic, not deterministic. The systems support this: every decision shifts probability curves, but nothing guarantees outcomes.

**Reputation is currency.** In the indie film world, your reputation precedes your checkbook. A studio known for treating talent well attracts better talent at lower rates. A studio known for butchering directors' cuts in the editing room will find top-tier directors going elsewhere. Reputation accumulates slowly and is destroyed quickly.

**Time kills.** Every project that sits in development costs money and morale. Every day on set costs budget. Every month between wrap and premiere costs momentum. The clock is always running, and the player who respects time survives longer than the player who respects only quality.

**The industry has memory.** That actor you lowballed in year one will remember in year five when she is a star. That critic you offended with an arrogant Q&A response will review your next film with that memory in hand. The Talent Web does not forget.

### Secrets: What the Player Discovers

The first secret: **the industry is smaller than it looks.** By the third or fourth production, the player will encounter the same names in different configurations. The editor who saved their second film was the assistant editor on their first film's rival. The agent who represents their favorite actor also represents their least favorite director. The web is dense and incestuous, and learning to navigate it is a form of mastery.

The deeper secret: **there is no separation between the art and the business.** The player who tries to "just focus on making good films" will discover that distribution strategy, festival timing, and financial management are creative decisions. The cut of the film is an artistic choice. The festival you premiere at is an artistic choice. The budget you set is an artistic choice. Everything is storytelling.

The deepest secret: **the studio becomes the player's creative work.** The individual films are projects. The studio -- its identity, its values, its roster, its reputation -- is the masterpiece. The game's final emotional revelation is that the player has not been managing a business. They have been authoring an institution, and that institution is a portrait of their values.

## 3. CHARACTERS

### Marlowe Finch -- The Veteran Writer

**Role:** The first writer in your stable. A novelist-turned-screenwriter who had one film produced in the late '90s -- a quiet domestic drama that got respectful reviews and vanished. She has been writing specs ever since, each one more personal and less commercial than the last.

**Desire:** She wants her work to be produced. Specifically, she wants *Undertow* -- a semi-autobiographical script about a woman caring for her mother with Alzheimer's -- to be made exactly as written.

**Need:** She needs to accept that collaboration is not compromise. Her isolation has become a prison disguised as integrity.

**Wound:** Her first produced film was recut by the distributor against her wishes. The version that played in theaters was not her film. She has never recovered from the violation.

**Lie:** "If I maintain total control, the work will be pure." The truth is that her insistence on control is preventing the work from existing at all.

**Arc:** If the player produces her work and respects her vision, Marlowe gradually opens to collaboration -- accepting a director's interpretation, allowing an actor's improvisation to improve a scene. If the player compromises her work for commercial reasons, she retreats further into isolation and eventually leaves the industry. Her arc is about trust.

**Voice:** Precise, literary, wary. Speaks in complete sentences. Uses metaphors drawn from domestic life -- cooking, gardening, architecture. Never raises her voice; her anger manifests as clipped politeness. Avoids industry jargon as a point of pride.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- *"I didn't write this script so a twenty-six-year-old with a reel of car commercials could tell me what the third act needs."*
- *"You want me to add a love interest. Let me ask you something. When you visit your dying mother, do you stop on the way to fall in love? No. You drive. You just drive."*
- *"I'll do the rewrite. But I need you to understand the difference between making a script better and making it easier."*

**Gameplay Function:** Marlowe is the player's first test of the art-vs-commerce tension. Her scripts are high-quality but unmarketable without careful handling. She is the canary in the coal mine of the player's values -- how they treat Marlowe in the first year predicts the studio they will build.

---

### Dex Amari -- The Volatile Actor

**Role:** A method actor in his mid-thirties with undeniable magnetism and a reputation for being difficult. He has been on the cusp of a breakthrough for five years. Agents describe him as "the most talented actor nobody will insure."

**Desire:** He wants to be recognized as a great actor. He wants the role that proves it -- something raw, transformative, the kind of performance that gets mentioned in the same breath as De Niro in *Raging Bull*.

**Need:** He needs to stop using "the work" as an excuse to avoid dealing with his personal wreckage. His commitment to the craft is genuine, but it is also a hiding place.

**Wound:** He was a child actor in a sitcom that ran for six seasons. He has spent his adult career trying to be taken seriously, and every audition room still sees the kid from the show first.

**Lie:** "If I go deep enough into a character, I won't have to be myself." The method is not just technique for Dex -- it is escape.

**Arc:** If the player casts Dex in the right role and manages his volatility with patience, he delivers a career-defining performance and begins to separate his identity from his characters. If the player enables his worst instincts -- indulging method extremes, ignoring warning signs -- Dex spirals. His arc is about the line between dedication and self-destruction.

**Voice:** Charismatic, intense, prone to monologue. Shifts registers depending on who he is talking to -- charming with producers, combative with directors, unexpectedly gentle with crew. Uses physical language: everything is about the body, the room, the space. Swears fluently but not lazily.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- *"I don't need you to understand why I'm sleeping in the van. I need you to understand that when I walk onto that set tomorrow, I will be the guy who sleeps in vans. And that's the performance you're paying for."*
- *"You know what the kid from that show would do? He'd hit his mark and say the line and collect the check. I'm not that kid. I haven't been that kid since I was seventeen and I put my fist through my dressing room mirror."*
- *"I read the script four times. It's good. But I need to know -- does the director see what I see? Because if he sees a sad man, I'm not interested. I see a man who has forgotten what sadness feels like. That's different. That's everything."*

**Gameplay Function:** Dex is the high-risk, high-reward talent. Casting him elevates any production's ceiling but dramatically increases volatility during the Production Clock. He is the embodiment of the game's core question about talent management: how much chaos will you tolerate from someone who might be brilliant?

### June Okoro -- The Pragmatist Producer

**Role:** An independent producer who has survived in the industry for fifteen years by knowing exactly when to push and when to fold. She is not in the player's employ -- she is a peer, a collaborator, and occasionally a rival who co-produces projects.

**Desire:** She wants to build a sustainable business that makes good films. Not great films -- good films. Films that get made, get seen, and make enough money to make the next one.

**Need:** She needs to risk failure. Her pragmatism has kept her alive, but it has also kept her safe, and safety has become a cage. She has never produced a film she is truly proud of.

**Wound:** Her mentor, a legendary indie producer, died broke and uninsured after a lifetime of making important films that never turned a profit. June watched the industry eulogize him while his family crowdfunded the funeral. She swore she would never be that person.

**Lie:** "Being responsible is the same as being good." June confuses survival with virtue. She judges risk-takers as reckless because admitting they might be courageous would indict her own caution.

**Arc:** If the player involves June in an ambitious project and it succeeds, she begins to recalibrate her risk tolerance -- not abandoning pragmatism but expanding what she believes is possible. If the player reinforces her caution by only pursuing safe projects with her, she becomes more controlling and eventually undermines creative ambition. Her arc is about the difference between wisdom and fear.

**Voice:** Direct, dry, numbers-literate. She speaks in short sentences. She has a producer's habit of reframing every creative aspiration as a budget line. Humor is her armor -- she is genuinely funny, and she knows it, and she deploys wit to deflect emotional vulnerability.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- *"Your director wants to shoot on 16mm. That's a twenty percent budget increase for texture most audiences won't notice. I love texture. I also love making payroll. Pick one."*
- *"I've been to eleven Sundances. You know what they all have in common? A filmmaker who thinks this is the year everything changes. And a rental car they can't afford to return."*
- *"You want the honest answer or the encouraging answer? Because I have both, and one of them involves math."*

**Gameplay Function:** June is the player's sounding board and counterweight. Co-producing with her reduces risk but caps upside. She offers the player a mirror for their commercial instincts -- and forces them to articulate why a risky project is worth the gamble.

---

### Tomasz Keller -- The Festival Programmer

**Role:** A senior programmer at a major festival (modeled loosely on Sundance, though never named as such). Tomasz is the gatekeeper -- the person who decides which films the world sees first.

**Desire:** He wants to discover the next masterpiece. He watches four hundred films a year and remembers the feeling of seeing something that changes what he thinks cinema can be. He is chasing that feeling.

**Need:** He needs to confront his own power. His taste shapes careers, and he has never fully reckoned with the responsibility that carries -- or the films he has overlooked because they did not fit his aesthetic.

**Wound:** He championed a film early in his career that turned out to be the vanity project of a wealthy dilettante. The critical backlash humiliated him publicly. He became more conservative in his selections, which he justifies as "rigorous" but which is actually defensive.

**Lie:** "I am objective. My selections are about quality, not preference." The truth is that Tomasz's taste is narrow and his objectivity is a performance. He favors a certain kind of film -- austere, literary, visually restrained -- and has blind spots wide enough to drive a camera truck through.

**Arc:** Tomasz's arc is experienced indirectly by the player through repeated festival interactions. If the player submits diverse work over time, Tomasz's selections gradually reveal his biases. The player learns to read him -- to anticipate what he values and either cater to it or challenge it. Tomasz does not change. The player's understanding of him deepens.

**Voice:** Erudite, European-inflected even when speaking English, slightly performative. He namedrops directors the way other people namecheck restaurants. He is sincere in his love of cinema but insufferable in his expression of it. His rejection letters are genuinely well-written, which somehow makes them worse.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- *"I watched your film twice. The first time, I admired it. The second time, I was less certain. Admiration that doesn't survive a second viewing is decoration, not art."*
- *"We received fourteen hundred submissions this year. I programmed forty-two. Every film I said yes to means thirty-two films I said no to. You want me to feel guilty about that arithmetic, but guilt would make me worse at this, not better."*
- *"Your cinematographer understands light. Your director understands people. But I'm not sure they understand each other, and that uncertainty lives in every frame."*

**Gameplay Function:** Tomasz represents the festival system -- its power, its subjectivity, and its capacity for both discovery and gatekeeping. Learning to navigate him (and programmers like him) is a core late-game skill.

---

### Ray Callisto -- The Agent

**Role:** A talent agent who operates in the indie-to-mainstream pipeline. Ray does not represent A-listers. He represents the people who are about to become A-listers, and his entire business model is built on that transition -- getting his clients exposure through indie films and then leveraging festival success into studio deals.

**Desire:** He wants his clients to succeed -- which means, in his framework, to become famous and wealthy. He views indie film as a stepping stone, not a destination.

**Need:** He needs to admit that he loves the work itself. Beneath the dealmaking persona, Ray is a cinephile who watches Criterion Channel films alone in his apartment. His cynicism is a costume he has worn so long he has forgotten it is not his skin.

**Wound:** He wanted to be a filmmaker. He went to film school. His thesis film was screened once, to an audience of nine people, four of whom were his family. He pivoted to representation and never looked back. Except he does look back. Every time he reads a good script, he looks back.

**Lie:** "I'm not a creative person. I'm a business person who works with creative people." Ray is, in fact, deeply creative -- his dealmaking is creative, his talent-reading is creative, his ability to match actor to role is a form of casting genius. But acknowledging this would mean confronting the filmmaker he chose not to become.

**Arc:** If the player builds a strong relationship with Ray and produces work that moves him, he gradually drops the agent mask. He starts making suggestions that serve the film rather than his client's career trajectory. He may even, in the late game, pitch the player a script -- his own. If the player treats Ray purely transactionally, he remains a dealmaker: effective, reliable, and hollow.

**Voice:** Fast, confident, performatively casual. Ray speaks in the language of deals -- numbers, leverage, positioning -- but peppers it with genuine film knowledge that slips out before he can stop it. He calls everyone "my friend" in a way that is both warm and non-committal. He is the kind of person who makes you feel like the most important person in the room and then takes a call mid-sentence.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- *"My client loves the script. He says it reminds him of early Malick, which -- between us -- means he thinks it's slow and wants to know if there's a festival strategy. But he loves it. He really does."*
- *"Here's the thing about Dex. Yes, he's difficult. Yes, the insurance premium makes your budget weep. But you put him in front of a camera with a script that has real bones, and he does something that nobody else alive can do. That's not worth nothing."*
- *"I'm not going to lie to you. I can get you three weeks of his time for that number. But I need something back. Your next film, if it's got a part for a mid-twenties female lead, my client Priya gets a look. Not a guarantee. A look. That's how this works, my friend."*

**Gameplay Function:** Ray is the player's primary interface with the talent market. He brokers deals, represents multiple talents in the Web, and his relationship with the player opens or closes doors to casting choices. He is also the source of industry intelligence -- he knows who is available, who is feuding, and who is about to break out.

---

### Elena Voss -- The First-Time Director

**Role:** A twenty-eight-year-old director whose short film won a student academy award and generated enough heat to get meetings. She has never directed a feature. She is talented, terrified, and the kind of person who either becomes the next Sofia Coppola or flames out before anyone remembers her name.

**Desire:** She wants to prove she can do this. She wants to direct a feature film that is undeniably hers -- not a producer's film, not a committee's film, her film.

**Need:** She needs to learn that accepting help is not the same as losing control. Her fierce independence is both her greatest strength and the thing that will isolate her on set.

**Wound:** She grew up watching her father, a commercial director, make advertisements for products he despised. He came home every night smelling like someone else's vision. She swore she would never make something she did not believe in.

**Lie:** "Asking for help means I'm not ready." Elena interprets every suggestion as a critique of her competence. She cannot yet distinguish between collaboration and interference.

**Arc:** If the player gives Elena a project and supports her without micromanaging, she grows into a confident director who learns to listen to her collaborators while maintaining her vision. If the player undermines her authority on set or forces compromises she has not agreed to, she either quits mid-production or delivers a film that she publicly disowns. Her arc is about the difference between strength and rigidity.

**Voice:** Earnest, specific, slightly over-prepared. Elena comes to every meeting with notes. She describes shots in painterly terms -- composition, color, light direction. She is not pretentious; she is precise. Her nervousness manifests as over-explanation. When she is confident, she becomes concise, and that shift is the tell that she has found her footing.

**Sample Dialogue:**
- *"I know the script says 'interior, kitchen, night.' But I see this scene happening at dawn. She's been up all night. The light is coming in gray and then slowly gold. That transition is the scene. If we shoot it at night, we lose it."*
- *"I watched the dailies three times. The performance is there. It's in take seven. But I need one more pass at the coverage because the wide shot has a compositional problem that -- I can fix it in editing but I'd rather fix it in camera. Can we get the set for twenty more minutes?"*
- *"I don't need you to believe in the film. I need you to believe in me long enough for me to finish it."*

**Gameplay Function:** Elena represents the high-risk investment in unproven talent. She is cheaper than experienced directors but more volatile. Nurturing her successfully pays dividends across multiple productions as she grows into a major talent. She is the player's opportunity to be the kind of producer the industry needs -- or the kind it already has too many of.

## 4. TONE GUIDE

### Adjectives

**Warm. Sharp. Wistful. Anxious. Alive.**

The tone is not cynical. It is knowing. The difference matters. Cynicism says nothing matters. This game says everything matters too much, and that is the problem. The warmth comes from genuine love of the creative process. The sharpness comes from clear-eyed observation of the systems that constrain it. The wistfulness comes from the mid-2000s setting -- a world on the cusp of changes it cannot see. The anxiety comes from financial precarity. The aliveness comes from the fact that despite all of it, these people are making things, and making things is the most electric human act there is.

### Tone References

- **Film:** *The Player* (Robert Altman) for the satirical edge; *Living in Oblivion* (Tom DiCillo) for the scrappy production chaos; *Lost in Translation* (Sofia Coppola) for the melancholy warmth; *Adaptation* (Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman) for the meta-awareness of creative process
- **Games:** *Disco Elysium* for personality-as-mechanic and prose quality; *Pentiment* for historical specificity and material culture; *Papers, Please* for the moral weight of bureaucratic decisions
- **Books:** *Pictures at a Revolution* (Mark Harris) for the industry history; *Down and Dirty Pictures* (Peter Biskind) for the indie film world's specific flavor of ambition and self-destruction
- **Music:** The Criterion Collection menu screen. A Sufjan Stevens album playing in a half-empty editing suite at midnight.

### Dialogue Rules

**Formal versus casual:** Casual default, formal when characters are performing for each other. Tomasz speaks formally because his identity requires it. Ray speaks casually because his identity requires the appearance of ease. Marlowe speaks formally because she does not trust informality. Dex shifts between registers depending on who has power in the room.

**Humor versus serious:** Humor is constant but never dominant. It is the defense mechanism of people under pressure. June is the funniest character because she uses humor to avoid vulnerability. The game itself should be funny in the way that a stressful job is funny -- the laughter of recognition, not the laughter of absurdity.

**Verbose versus terse:** Coverage reports and industry communications are verbose -- they are parodies of real industry language, and their verbosity is part of the satire. Character dialogue is terse when it matters. The most important lines in the game should be short. "I'm in." "It's not ready." "We're out of money." Brevity carries emotional weight.

**General rules:**
- No character ever says exactly what they mean on the first try. People in this world talk around things before landing on them.
- Industry jargon is used correctly and without explanation. The player learns it through context, the way you learn any language -- by immersion.
- Never break the fourth wall. The fiction is sacred.
- Profanity is earned, not sprinkled. When a character swears, it means something has broken through their composure.

### What This World Is NOT

- **Not a parody.** The game loves filmmaking and the people who do it. Satire is present, but it is the satire of someone who has been in the room, not someone mocking the room from outside.
- **Not nostalgic.** The mid-2000s setting is specific and lived-in, not a sepia-toned remember-when. The world has problems. The industry has rot. Nostalgia would be dishonest.
- **Not grimdark.** There is real struggle and real pain, but there is also joy, surprise, creative communion, and the irreplaceable high of seeing something you made resonate with a stranger. The tone is ultimately humanist.
- **Not ironic.** These characters care. The game cares. Ironic detachment is the enemy of everything this narrative is trying to do.
- **Not a Hollywood fantasy.** No red carpets, no limousines, no mansions. This is indie film. The glamour is a filmmaker crying in a bathroom at a Sundance after-party because a stranger told her that the movie changed his life. That is the glamour. It is enough.

### Sample Passages

**Script Coverage Report (procedural text example):**

> **TITLE:** *The Apiarist*
> **WRITER:** Daria Mosk (first submission)
> **GENRE:** Drama / Magical Realism
> **LOGLINE:** A beekeeper in upstate New York discovers her hives are producing honey with psychoactive properties, forcing her to choose between exploiting the discovery and protecting the ecosystem she has spent her life tending.
> **READER'S NOTES:** The premise walks a razor between literary fiction and B-movie absurdity, and Mosk navigates it with remarkable control for a first-time writer. The beekeeper's voice is fully realized -- specific, laconic, rooted in physical labor. The third act wobbles when the script introduces a government agency subplot that feels imported from a different, lesser film. If Mosk can be persuaded to stay small, this has festival-circuit DNA. If she cannot, this becomes a curiosity that collapses under its own ambition. RECOMMEND WITH RESERVATIONS.

**Environmental Text (office notice board):**

> ALL-STAFF: The production office refrigerator is not a landfill. The hummus has been there since pre-production on UNDERTOW. That was four months ago. The hummus has achieved sentience. It does not want to be here any more than you want to smell it. Please dispose of your expired items by Friday or the fridge will be emptied without mercy.
> -- June

**Festival Jury Feedback (post-screening report):**

> Your film *Night Shift* was screened for the jury on Thursday evening in the 7:30 PM slot. Audience response was attentive but muted during the first act, with notable engagement increasing through the midpoint reversal. The Q&A was well-attended. One jury member described the lead performance as "the most honest work I've seen this festival." Another noted that the film's pacing "rewards patience but does not always earn it." The overall assessment places *Night Shift* in the upper quartile of this year's competition slate. Formal results will be announced Saturday evening.

## 5. NARRATIVE-MECHANIC INTEGRATION

Every mechanic tells a story. This section maps where.

### The Greenlight Table: A Story About Courage

The Greenlight Table is where the player's values become action. The mechanic is simple -- choose which scripts to develop -- but the narrative weight is immense. Every script that crosses the table represents someone's creative ambition. Rejecting a script is not a neutral mechanical action. It is a judgment. The coverage reports are written to make the player feel the weight of that judgment, to make every greenlight feel like a commitment and every rejection feel like a small death.

What does the player FEEL when they read a coverage report? They should feel what a real producer feels: the spark of possibility, the mental casting, the budget math running in the background, the fear of committing to the wrong project. The procedural text must have voice, personality, and the occasional flash of genuine wit.

### The Talent Web: A Story About Loyalty

The Talent Web tells a story about relationships over time. Every hiring decision is a relationship decision. Casting Dex means committing to managing Dex's volatility for the duration of the production. Hiring Elena means betting on potential over experience. These are not stat comparisons -- they are character assessments that the player makes based on accumulated knowledge of the people in their world.

The narrative integrates through memory. The Web tracks history: who worked together, who fought, who flourished. A returning collaborator carries emotional weight -- the player remembers the last production, the crises they navigated together. A former collaborator who left on bad terms reappears with leverage. The Web is a story engine disguised as a management tool.

### The Production Clock: A Story About Compromise

The Production Clock is where the player's plan collides with reality, and the narrative purpose of that collision is to force compromise. Every crisis event is a micro-story: the actor who cannot find the emotion, the location that falls through, the weather that will not cooperate. These are not random obstacles. They are narrative moments that ask the player to choose between competing goods -- quality versus schedule, morale versus budget, the director's vision versus the producer's pragmatism.

Where does the world crack during production? It cracks in the small moments. The grip who tells you that the crew is exhausted. The actor who asks for five more minutes on a take and you look at the clock and the budget and the fading light and you have to decide. These moments are where the game lives.

### The Avid Bay: A Story About Truth

Post-production tells a story about what the film actually is versus what the player hoped it would be. The footage is shot. The performances are captured. The question is no longer "What film are we making?" It is "What film did we make?" The editorial choices in the Avid Bay are the most honest moment in the production cycle -- the moment when the player sees their decisions reflected back as a finished work and must accept or reshape the result.

### The Festival Circuit: A Story About Judgment

The festival system tells a story about validation and its limits. The player submits their film to be judged by strangers with their own tastes, biases, and moods. The outcome is partially within the player's control (the quality of the film, the strategic choice of festival) and partially beyond it (jury composition, competing films, the cultural moment). This mirrors the real experience of releasing creative work into the world: you do your best and then you let go.

### The Ledger: A Story About Survival

The financial system is not a separate mechanic. It is the ever-present undertow beneath every creative decision. The Ledger tells a story about what art costs -- not metaphorically but literally. When the player looks at their bank balance after a failed release, the number is not data. It is the distance between their current reality and their next film. When the number is low enough, every creative decision becomes an existential one. The Ledger ensures that the art-vs-commerce tension is not philosophical. It is visceral.

### Environmental Storytelling

The office itself tells the studio's story. Early-game offices show ambition and scrappiness: scripts everywhere, a whiteboard covered in frantic scheduling, a cheap poster on the wall. Mid-game offices show success or its absence: framed one-sheets from produced films, better furniture, or stacks of unreturned festival programs and a collection notice pinned to the board. Late-game offices tell a legacy story: the walls are a gallery of the player's choices, and walking through the space should feel like walking through a career.

## 6. LORE HIERARCHY

### Need-to-Know (The Player MUST Understand This)

- The player runs an indie film studio in the mid-2000s.
- Films are produced through a pipeline: development, pre-production, production, post-production, release.
- Talent has personalities, relationships, and egos that affect production.
- Money is finite. Each film is a financial risk.
- Festivals are the primary path to recognition and revenue.
- The studio's reputation shapes what talent and projects are available.

### Want-to-Know (Enriches the Experience for Curious Players)

- The historical context of the mid-2000s indie film scene: the Miramax collapse, the digital transition, the mumblecore movement.
- Individual character backstories: Marlowe's recut film, Dex's sitcom past, June's mentor's death, Elena's father's commercial work.
- Festival politics: how jury composition affects outcomes, how premiere slots carry different weight, why Toronto deal-making is different from Cannes prestige.
- The economics of physical media: why DVD revenue matters, why its decline is catastrophic, why nobody is talking about it yet.
- The cultural significance of specific films referenced in coverage reports and character dialogue.

### Deep Lore (Rewards Dedicated Fans and Lore Hunters)

- The complete history of the fictional "Meridian Films," the Miramax-like company whose collapse created the power vacuum your studio occupies. Office documents, old trade press clippings, and veteran characters' anecdotes piece together the story of what Meridian was and why it fell.
- The interconnected histories of the Talent Web characters before the game begins. Dex and Elena almost worked together on a student film that fell apart. Ray once represented Marlowe and they parted ways badly. June co-produced a film for Meridian that Tomasz selected for his festival, and it was the film that humiliated him. Every thread connects.
- The evolving industry statistics visible in trade publications around the office. Box office numbers, average production budgets, festival submission counts -- all historically grounded and all telling the story of an industry in transition.
- A recurring motif: a fictional film called *The Long Dissolve* that every veteran character references differently. It was either a masterpiece or a disaster, depending on who you ask. It was either produced by Meridian or killed by Meridian. It either exists in a vault somewhere or was never finished. The player never sees it. It is the world's ghost story -- a film that represents everything independent cinema could be and everything the industry does to prevent it.

### Never-Told (Internal Consistency Only)

- The specific financial details of Meridian's collapse: which investors pulled out, what the debt structure looked like, which executives went where. This informs character backstories but is never exposed to the player.
- The real name of the festival Tomasz programs for. It is never named because naming it would invite direct comparison to real festivals. The game's festivals are composites.
- Ray's thesis film. It exists in the Talent Web's backend data -- it has a title, a logline, a quality score. The player never sees it unless Ray offers it in the late game, and even then, only the title and logline are revealed.
- The complete timeline of Dex's childhood acting career: episode counts, contract disputes, the specific incident that ended the show. Characters reference it in fragments. The full picture exists only in design documentation.
- The mathematical model underlying jury taste. Players can learn to read jury tendencies through observation, but the precise algorithm is never surfaced. Taste should feel human, not computable.

## 7. TIMELINE OF MAJOR EVENTS

### Pre-Game History

**1989** -- The Sundance Effect begins. Independent cinema enters its commercial era.

**1994** -- *Pulp Fiction* at Cannes. The cultural peak. Every film student in America believes they are the next Tarantino.

**1996** -- Meridian Films is founded by Sol Archer, a producer with Miramax connections and ambitions to build "a studio with a conscience." Early successes include *Glass Hours* (a festival darling) and *Rivermouth* (a modest commercial hit).

**1999** -- Meridian's peak year. Three films in festival competition simultaneously. Sol Archer is profiled in The New York Times as "the future of independent cinema." Behind the scenes, the books are bleeding. Growth has outpaced revenue.

**2001** -- Meridian takes on private equity investment to cover operating losses. The investors want commercial returns. Sol Archer begins compromising his slate. Internal morale collapses.

**2003** -- Meridian shutters after a catastrophic year: two expensive productions underperform, a distribution deal falls through, and the lead investor demands liquidation. Sol Archer disappears from the industry. Forty-three employees lose their jobs. The industry treats it as a cautionary tale and then forgets it within six months.

**2004** -- The Miramax-Disney divorce. The DVD market shows its first decline. DV cameras cross the quality threshold. The ground is shifting.

### In-Game Timeline

**Year 1 (2005)** -- The player opens their studio. The world is volatile and full of possibility. Marlowe Finch submits *Undertow* within the first quarter. Elena Voss is looking for her first feature opportunity. Dex Amari is available because no one else will insure him. The player makes their first film.

**Year 2 (2006)** -- The consequences of Year 1 manifest. If the first film succeeded, better talent becomes available. If it failed, the player must rebuild credibility on a tighter budget. June Okoro approaches the player with a co-production opportunity. The first rival studio emerges in the player's awareness.

**Year 3 (2007)** -- The industry shift accelerates. DVD revenue drops visibly. A major studio launches a "specialty division" that competes directly with indie studios for festival slots and talent. The player's early collaborators begin evolving -- actors who debuted in the player's films get offers from bigger productions. Loyalty is tested.

**Year 4 (2008)** -- The financial crisis hits. Investors pull back. Grant money dries up. The Ledger becomes a survival story. Films that were greenlit in abundance now compete for scarce resources. The player must decide which projects survive the contraction.

**Year 5 (2009)** -- The streaming question begins. A new distribution platform offers the player a deal: guaranteed revenue in exchange for exclusive digital rights, bypassing festivals entirely. The old model and the new model collide. Characters take sides. The player's studio identity is tested by the most fundamental question yet: what is a film, and how should it reach its audience?

**Year 6-8 (2010-2012)** -- The late game. The player's studio has a legacy. Retrospectives, profiles, imitators. Former collaborators are now established figures with their own careers and opinions. The industry has transformed around the player. The final question is not whether the studio survives. It is what the studio means.

## 8. OPEN QUESTIONS

These are not holes. They are spaces where the narrative breathes, where design decisions will shape the story's final form.

**How does the player's studio identity crystallize into language?** The emergent narrative needs a moment -- a review, a profile, a festival introduction -- where the player sees their studio described by the world. "The studio that takes risks on first-time directors." "The studio that makes beautiful films nobody sees." "The studio that sold out so gradually, nobody noticed." How and when does this mirror appear? What does the player FEEL when they see themselves described?

**How do we handle the industry's complicity with abuse?** The mid-2000s indie film scene existed within structures of exploitation -- not just financial, but personal. The Weinstein shadow is present in the world's DNA. The game cannot pretend this did not exist, but it also cannot gamify abuse. The current approach: the power dynamics are visible in the systems (who has leverage, who is vulnerable, how institutions protect their investments over their people), but specific instances of abuse are not simulated. The culture is depicted. The crimes are not. Is this sufficient? Is it honest? This question must be revisited throughout development.

**What is the role of the player's own taste?** The Greenlight Table asks the player to choose projects based on coverage reports. But does the player develop taste within the game? Can they learn to read a coverage report the way a real producer does -- spotting the script with hidden potential, recognizing the one that sounds good but is actually hollow? If so, taste becomes a skill. If not, it remains a gamble. The former is more interesting. How do we teach it without making it formulaic?

**How does the physical media transition manifest emotionally?** The DVD decline is an economic fact in the Ledger, but it is also a cultural loss. Characters should have feelings about it. The editor who loves the idea of her work on a shelf, in a case, with cover art. The director who refuses to acknowledge that the format is dying. The young filmmaker who has never cared about physical media and does not understand why anyone is mourning. Where does the world crack on this question?

**What happens when a former collaborator becomes a rival?** The Talent Web tracks relationships over time. An actor who debuted in the player's first film may, by Year 5, be choosing between the player's new project and a bigger offer from a competitor. The narrative opportunity is immense: betrayal, loyalty, negotiation, the recognition that people outgrow each other. How explicit should this narrative be? Should it be told through events and dialogue, or should it live purely in the systems?

**What is the player's final legacy?** The game does not have a traditional ending, but it needs a moment of culmination. The Criterion Shelf stretch goal is one answer -- a curated library of the player's best work, immortalized with generated cover art and pull quotes. But is there a narrative culmination? A retrospective screening. A lifetime achievement award. A protege who carries the studio's values into the next era. Or simply: the office, at the end of a long day, with the player's films on the wall and a new script on the desk. What does the player FEEL in the last hour? What is the silence that the game leaves them in?

**Who is the player when no one is watching?** This is the question the game asks from the first greenlight to the last premiere. The answer is different every time. That is the point.

*This Narrative Bible is a living document. It will grow as the game grows. But its foundation is fixed: every mechanic tells a story, every character wants something they cannot easily have, and the world's wound -- the lie that art can sustain itself without compromise -- is the crack through which all light and all darkness enters.*

*The player will feel this. Not because we tell them. Because they live it.*
